def px(x: int | float) -> str:
    """
    Helper for providing a CSS length value in pixels.

    For certain parameters, a length value is required. Examples include the setting of font sizes
    (e.g., in `cell_text()`) and thicknesses of lines (e.g., in `cell_borders()`). Setting a length
    in pixels with `px()` allows for an absolute definition of size as opposed to the analogous
    helper function `pct()`.

    Parameters
    ----------
    x
        The integer or float value to format as a string (e.g., `"12px"`) for some arguments that
        can take values as units of pixels.

    Examples
    --------
        >>> from gt import *
        >>> x = gt.px(12)
        >>> x
        >>> print(x)

def pct(x: int | float) -> str:
    """
    Helper for providing a CSS length value as a percentage.

    A percentage value acts as a length value that is relative to an initial state. For instance an
    80% value for something will size the target to 80% the size of its 'previous' value. This type
    of sizing is useful for sizing up or down a length value with an intuitive measure. This helper
    function can be used for the setting of font sizes (e.g., in `cell_text()`) and altering the
    thicknesses of lines (e.g., in `cell_borders()`. Should a more exact definition of size be
    required, the analogous helper function `pct()` will be more useful.

    Parameters
    ----------
    x
        The integer or float value to format as a string-based percentage value for some arguments
        that can take percentage values.

    Examples
    --------
        >>> from gt import *

    Parameters
    ----------
    name
        The name of the Google Font to use.

    Returns
    -------
    GoogleFont
        A GoogleFont object, which contains the name of the font and methods for incorporating the
        font in HTML output tables.

    Examples
    --------
    Let's use the `exibble` dataset to create a table of two columns and eight rows. We'll replace
    missing values with em dashes using [`sub_missing()`](`great_tables.GT.sub_missing`). For text
    in the time column, we will use the font called `"IBM Plex Mono"` which is available from Google
    Fonts. This is defined inside the `google_font()` call, itself within the
    [`style.text()`](`great_tables.style.text`) method that's applied to the `style=` parameter of
    [`tab_style()`](`great_tables.GT.tab_style`).

    ```{python}
    from great_tables import GT, exibble, style, loc, google_font

    (
        GT(exibble[["char", "time"]])
        .sub_missing()

            style=style.text(font=google_font(name="IBM Plex Mono")),
            locations=loc.body(columns="time")
        )
    )
    ```

    We can use a subset of the `sp500` dataset to create a small table. With
    [`fmt_currency()`](`great_tables.GT.fmt_currency`), we can display values as monetary values.
    Then, we'll set a larger font size for the table and opt to use the `"Merriweather"` font by
    calling `google_font()` within [`opt_table_font()`](`great_tables.GT.opt_table_font`). In cases
    where that font may not materialize, we include two font fallbacks: `"Cochin"` and the catchall
    `"Serif"` group.

    ```{python}
    from great_tables import GT, google_font
    from great_tables.data import sp500

    (
        GT(sp500.drop(columns=["volume", "adj_close"]).head(10))

    The font stacks and the individual fonts used by platform
    ---------------------------------------------------------
    ### System UI (`"system-ui"`)

    ```css
    font-family: system-ui, sans-serif;
    ```

    The operating system interface's default typefaces are known as system UI fonts. They contain a
    variety of font weights, are quite readable at small sizes, and are perfect for UI elements.
    These typefaces serve as a great starting point for text in data tables and so this font stack
    is the default for **Great Tables**.

    ### Transitional (`"transitional"`)

    ```css
    font-family: Charter, 'Bitstream Charter', 'Sitka Text', Cambria, serif;
    ```

    The Enlightenment saw the development of transitional typefaces, which combine Old Style and
    Modern typefaces. *Times New Roman*, a transitional typeface created for the Times of London
    newspaper, is among the most well-known instances of this style.

    ### Old Style (`"old-style"`)

    ```css
    font-family: 'Iowan Old Style', 'Palatino Linotype', 'URW Palladio L', P052, serif;
    ```

    Old style typefaces were created during the Renaissance and are distinguished by diagonal
    stress, a lack of contrast between thick and thin strokes, and rounded serifs. *Garamond* is
    among the most well-known instances of an antique typeface.

    ### Humanist (`"humanist"`)

    ```css
    font-family: Seravek, 'Gill Sans Nova', Ubuntu, Calibri, 'DejaVu Sans', source-sans-pro, sans-serif;
    ```

    Low contrast between thick and thin strokes and organic, calligraphic forms are traits of
    humanist typefaces. These typefaces, which draw their inspiration from Renaissance calligraphy,
    are frequently regarded as being more readable and easier to read than other sans serif
    typefaces.

    ### Geometric Humanist (`"geometric-humanist"`)

    ```css
    font-family: Avenir, Montserrat, Corbel, 'URW Gothic', source-sans-pro, sans-serif;
    ```

    Clean, geometric forms and consistent stroke widths are characteristics of geometric humanist
    typefaces. These typefaces, which are frequently used for headlines and other display purposes,
    are frequently thought to be contemporary and slick in appearance. A well-known example of this
    classification is *Futura*.

    ### Classical Humanist (`"classical-humanist"`)

    ```css
    font-family: Optima, Candara, 'Noto Sans', source-sans-pro, sans-serif;
    ```

    The way the strokes gradually widen as they approach the stroke terminals without ending in a
    serif is what distinguishes classical humanist typefaces. The stone carving on Renaissance-era
    tombstones and classical Roman capitals served as inspiration for these typefaces.

    ### Neo-Grotesque (`"neo-grotesque"`)

    ```css
    font-family: Inter, Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', 'Arial Nova', 'Nimbus Sans', Arial, sans-serif;
    ```

    Neo-grotesque typefaces are a form of sans serif that originated in the late 19th and early 20th
    centuries. They are distinguished by their crisp, geometric shapes and regular stroke widths.
    *Helvetica* is among the most well-known examples of a Neo-grotesque typeface.

    ### Monospace Slab Serif (`"monospace-slab-serif"`)

    ```css
    font-family: 'Nimbus Mono PS', 'Courier New', monospace;
    ```

    Monospace slab serif typefaces are distinguished by their fixed-width letters, which are the
    same width irrespective of their shape, and their straightforward, geometric forms. For reports,
    tabular work, and technical documentation, this technique is used to simulate typewriter output.

    ### Monospace Code (`"monospace-code"`)

    ```css
    font-family: ui-monospace, 'Cascadia Code', 'Source Code Pro', Menlo, Consolas, 'DejaVu Sans Mono', monospace;
    ```

    Specifically created for use in programming and other technical applications, monospace code
    typefaces are used in these fields. These typefaces are distinguished by their clear, readable
    forms and monospaced design, which ensures that all letters and characters are the same width.

    ### Industrial (`"industrial"`)

    ```css
    font-family: Bahnschrift, 'DIN Alternate', 'Franklin Gothic Medium', 'Nimbus Sans Narrow', sans-serif-condensed, sans-serif;
    ```

    The development of industrial typefaces began in the late 19th century and was greatly
    influenced by the industrial and technological advancements of the time. Industrial typefaces
    are distinguished by their strong sans serif letterforms, straightforward appearance, and use of
    geometric shapes and straight lines.

    ### Rounded Sans (`"rounded-sans"`)

    ```css
    font-family: ui-rounded, 'Hiragino Maru Gothic ProN', Quicksand, Comfortaa, Manjari, 'Arial Rounded MT', 'Arial Rounded MT Bold', Calibri, source-sans-pro, sans-serif;
    ```

    The rounded, curved letterforms that define rounded typefaces give them a softer, friendlier
    appearance. The typeface's rounded edges give it a more natural and playful feel, making it
    appropriate for use in casual or kid-friendly designs. Since the 1950s, the rounded sans-serif
    design has gained popularity and is still frequently used in branding, graphic design, and other
    fields.

    ### Slab Serif (`"slab-serif"`)

    ```css
    font-family: Rockwell, 'Rockwell Nova', 'Roboto Slab', 'DejaVu Serif', 'Sitka Small', serif;
    ```

    Slab Serif typefaces are distinguished by the thick, block-like serifs that appear at the ends
    of each letterform. Typically, these serifs are unbracketed, which means that they do not have
    any curved or tapered transitions to the letter's main stroke.

    ### Antique (`"antique"`)

    ```css
    font-family: Superclarendon, 'Bookman Old Style', 'URW Bookman', 'URW Bookman L', 'Georgia Pro', Georgia, serif;
    ```

    Serif typefaces that were popular in the 19th century include antique typefaces, also referred
    to as Egyptians. They are distinguished by their thick, uniform stroke weight and block-like
    serifs. The typeface *Clarendon* is a highly regarded example of this style and *Superclarendon*
    is a modern take on that revered typeface.

    ### Didone (`"didone"`)

    ```css
    font-family: Didot, 'Bodoni MT', 'Noto Serif Display', 'URW Palladio L', P052, Sylfaen, serif;
    ```

    Didone typefaces, also referred to as Modern typefaces, are distinguished by their vertical
    stress, sharp contrast between thick and thin strokes, and hairline serifs without bracketing.
    The Didone style first appeared in the late 18th century and became well-known in the early
    19th century. *Bodoni* and *Didot* are two of the most well-known typefaces in this category.

    ### Handwritten (`"handwritten"`)

    ```css
    font-family: 'Segoe Print', 'Bradley Hand', Chilanka, TSCu_Comic, casual, cursive;
    ```

    The appearance and feel of handwriting are replicated by handwritten typefaces. Although there
    are a wide variety of handwriting styles, this font stack tends to use a more casual and
    commonplace style. In regards to these types of fonts in tables, one can say that any table
    having a handwritten font will evoke a feeling of gleefulness.

    Examples
    --------
    Using select columns from the `exibble` dataset, let's create a table with a number of
    components added. Following that, we'll set a font for the entire table using the
    `tab_options()` method with the `table_font_names` parameter. Instead of passing a list of font
    names, we'll use the `system_fonts()` helper function to get a font stack. In this case, we'll
    use the `"industrial"` font stack.

    ```{python}
    from great_tables import GT, exibble, md, system_fonts

    (
      GT(
        exibble[["num", "char", "currency", "row", "group"]],
        rowname_col="row",
        groupname_col="group"
      )
      .tab_header(
        title=md("Data listing from **exibble**"),
        subtitle=md("`exibble` is a **Great Tables** dataset.")
      )
      .fmt_number(columns="num")
      .fmt_currency(columns="currency")
      .tab_source_note(source_note="This is only a subset of the dataset.")
      .opt_align_table_header(align="left")
      .tab_options(table_font_names=system_fonts("industrial"))
    )
    ```

    Invoking the `system_fonts()` helper function with the `"industrial"` argument will return a
    list of font names that make up the font stack. This is exactly the type of input that the
    `table_font_names` parameter requires.

def define_units(units_notation: str) -> UnitDefinitionList:

    With `define_units()` you can work with a specially-crafted units notation string and emit the
    units as HTML (with the `.to_html()` method). This function is useful as a standalone utility
    and it powers the `fmt_units()` method in **Great Tables**.

    Parameters
    ----------
    units_notation : str
        A string of units notation.

    Returns
    -------
    UnitDefinitionList
        A list of unit definitions.

    Specification of units notation
    -------------------------------

    The following table demonstrates the various ways in which units can be specified in the
    `units_notation` string and how the input is processed by the `define_units()` function. The
    concluding step for display of the units in HTML is to use the `to_html()` method.

    Helper for setting the options for a nanoplot.

    When using `cols_nanoplot()`, the defaults for the generated nanoplots can be modified with
    `nanoplot_options()` within the `options=` argument.

    Parameters
    ----------

    data_point_radius
        The `data_point_radius=` option lets you set the radius for each of the data points. By
        default this is set to `10`. Individual radius values can be set by using a list of numeric
        values; however, the list provided must match the number of data points.
    data_point_stroke_color
        The default stroke color of the data points is `"#FFFFFF"` (`"white"`). This works well when
        there is a visible data line combined with data points with a darker fill color. The stroke
        color can be modified with `data_point_stroke_color=` for all data points by supplying a
        single color value. With a list of colors, each data point's stroke color can be changed
        (ensure that the list length matches the number of data points).
    data_point_stroke_width
        The width of the outside stroke for the data points can be modified with the
        `data_point_stroke_width=` option. By default, a value of `4` (as in '4px') is used.
    data_point_fill_color
        By default, all data points have a fill color of `"#FF0000"` (`"red"`). This can be changed
        for all data points by providing a different color to `data_point_fill_color=`. And, a list
        of different colors can be supplied so long as the length is equal to the number of data
        points; the fill color values will be applied in order of left to right.
    data_line_type
        This can accept either `"curved"` or `"straight"`. Curved lines are recommended when the
        nanoplot has less than 30 points and data points are evenly spaced. In most other cases,
        straight lines might present better.
    data_line_stroke_color
        The color of the data line can be modified from its default `"#4682B4"` (`"steelblue"`)
        color by supplying a color to the `data_line_stroke_color=` option.
    data_line_stroke_width
        The width of the connecting data line can be modified with `data_line_stroke_width=`. By
        default, a value of `4` (as in '4px') is used.
    data_area_fill_color
        The fill color for the area that bounds the data points in line plot. The default is
        `"#FF0000"` (`"red"`) but can be changed by providing a color value to
        `data_area_fill_color=`.
    data_bar_stroke_color
        The color of the stroke used for the data bars can be modified from its default `"#3290CC"`
        color by supplying a color to `data_bar_stroke_color=`.
    data_bar_stroke_width
        The width of the stroke used for the data bars can be modified with the
        `data_bar_stroke_width=` option. By default, a value of `4` (as in '4px') is used.
    data_bar_fill_color
        By default, all data bars have a fill color of `"#3FB5FF"`. This can be changed for all data
        bars by providing a different color to `data_bar_fill_color=`. And, a list of different
        colors can be supplied so long as the length is equal to the number of data bars; the fill
        color values will be applied in order of left to right.
    data_bar_negative_stroke_color
        The color of the stroke used for the data bars that have negative values. The default color
        is `"#CC3243"` but this can be changed by supplying a color value to the
        `data_bar_negative_stroke_color=` option.
    data_bar_negative_stroke_width
        The width of the stroke used for negative value data bars. This has the same default as
        `data_bar_stroke_width=` with a value of `4` (as in '4px'). This can be changed by giving a
        numeric value to the `data_bar_negative_stroke_width=` option.
    data_bar_negative_fill_color
        By default, all negative data bars have a fill color of `"#D75A68"`. This can however be
        changed by providing a color value to `data_bar_negative_fill_color=`.
    reference_line_color
        The reference line will have a color of `"#75A8B0"` if it is set to appear. This color can
        be changed by providing a single color value to `reference_line_color=`.
    reference_area_fill_color
        If a reference area has been defined and is visible it has by default a fill color of
        `"#A6E6F2"`. This can be modified by declaring a color value in the
        `reference_area_fill_color=` option.
    vertical_guide_stroke_color
        Vertical guides appear when hovering in the vicinity of data points. Their default color is
        `"#911EB4"` (a strong magenta color) and a fill opacity value of `0.4` is automatically
        applied to this. However, the base color can be changed with the
        `vertical_guide_stroke_color=` option.
    vertical_guide_stroke_width
        The vertical guide's stroke width, by default, is relatively large at `12` (this is '12px').
        This is modifiable by setting a different value with `vertical_guide_stroke_width=`.
    show_data_points
        By default, all data points in a nanoplot are shown but this layer can be hidden by setting
        `show_data_points=` to `False`.
    show_data_line
        The data line connects data points together and it is shown by default. This data line layer
        can be hidden by setting `show_data_line=` to `False`.
    show_data_area
        The data area layer is adjacent to the data points and the data line. It is shown by default
        but can be hidden with `show_data_area=False`.
    show_reference_line
        The layer with a horizontal reference line appears underneath that of the data points and
        the data line. Like vertical guides, hovering over a reference will show its value. The
        reference line (if available) is shown by default but can be hidden by setting
        `show_reference_line=` to `False`.
    show_reference_area
        The reference area appears at the very bottom of the layer stack, if it is available (i.e.,
        defined in `cols_nanoplot()`). It will be shown in the default case but can be hidden by
        using `show_reference_area=False`.
    show_vertical_guides
        Vertical guides appear when hovering over data points. This hidden layer is active by
        default but can be deactivated by using `show_vertical_guides=False`.
    show_y_axis_guide
        The *y*-axis guide will appear when hovering over the far left side of a nanoplot. This
        hidden layer is active by default but can be deactivated by using `show_y_axis_guide=False`.
    interactive_data_values
        By default, numeric data values will be shown only when the user interacts with certain
        regions of a nanoplot. This is because the values may be numerous (i.e., clutter the display
        when all are visible) and it can be argued that the values themselves are secondary to the
        presentation. However, for some types of plots (like horizontal bar plots), a persistent
        display of values alongside the plot marks may be desirable. By setting
        `interactive_data_values=False` we can opt for always displaying the data values alongside
        the plot components.
    y_val_fmt_fn
        If providing a function to `y_val_fmt_fn=`, customized formatting of the *y* values
        associated with the data points/bars is possible.
    y_axis_fmt_fn
        A function supplied to `y_axis_fmt_fn=` will result in customized formatting of the *y*-axis
        label values.
    y_ref_line_fmt_fn
        Providing a function for `y_ref_line_fmt_fn=` yields customized formatting of the reference
        line (if present).
    currency
        If the values are to be displayed as currency values, supply either: (1) a 3-letter currency
        code (e.g., `"USD"` for U.S. Dollars, `"EUR"` for the Euro currency), or (2) a common
        currency name (e.g., `"dollar"`, `"pound"`, `"yen"`, etc.).
