    Save a table as an image file or a PDF document.

    The `save()` method makes it easy to save a table object as an image file. The function produces
    a high-resolution image file or PDF of the table. The output file is create by first taking a
    screenshot of the table using a headless Chrome browser. Then, the screenshot is then cropped to
    only include the table element. Finally, and the resulting image is saved to the specified file
    path in the format specified (via the file extension).

    Parameters
    ----------
    file
        The name of the file to save the image to. Accepts names ending with .png, .bmp, and other
        image extensions. Also accepts the extension .pdf.
    selector
        The HTML element selector to use to select the table. By default, this is set to "table",
        which selects the first table element in the HTML content.
    scale
        The scaling factor that will be used when generating the image. By default, this is set to a
        value of `1.0`. Lowering this will result in a smaller image, whereas increasing it will
        result in a much higher-resolution image. This can be considered a quality setting, yet it
        also affects the file size. The default value of `1.0` is a good balance between file size
        and quality.
    expand
        The number of pixels to expand the screenshot by. By default, this is set to 5. This can be
        increased to capture more of the surrounding area, or decreased to capture less.
    window_size
        The size of the window to use when taking the screenshot. This is a tuple of two integers,
        representing the width and height of the window. By default, this is set to `(6000, 6000)`,
        a large size that should be sufficient for most tables. If the table is larger than this
        (and this will be obvious once inspecting the image file) you can increase the appropriate
        values of the tuple. If the table is very small, then a reduction in these these values will
        result in a speed gain during image capture. Please note that the window size is *not* the
        same as the final image size. The table will be captured at the same size as it is displayed
        in the headless browser, and the window size is used to ensure that the entire table is
        visible in the screen capture before the cropping process occurs.

    Returns
    -------
    None
        This function does not return anything; it simply saves the image to the specified file
        path.

    Details
    -------
    We create the output file based on the HTML version of the table.

    This process is facilitated by two libraries:

    - `selenium`, which is used to control the Chrome browser and take a screenshot of the table.
    - `PIL`, which is used to crop the screenshot to only include the table element of the page.

    Both of these packages needs to be installed before attempting to save any table as an image
    file. The `selenium` package also requires the Chrome browser to be installed on the system.

    A pip-based reinstallation of **Great Tables** through the following command will install these
    required packages:

    ```bash
    pip install great_tables[extra]
