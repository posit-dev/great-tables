    "text": "Absolutely Delightful Table-making in Python\nWith Great Tables anyone can make wonderful-looking tables in Python. The philosophy here is that we can construct a wide variety of useful tables by working with a cohesive set of table components. You can mix and match things like a header and footer, attach a stub (which contains row labels), arrange spanner labels over top of the column labels, and much more. Not only that, but you can format the cell values in a variety of awesome ways.\nIt all begins with table data in the form of a Pandas or Polars DataFrame. You then decide how to compose your output table with the elements and formatting you need for the task at hand. Finally, the table is rendered by printing it at the console, including it in an notebook environment, or rendering it inside a Quarto document.\nThe Great Tables package is designed to be both straightforward yet powerful. The emphasis is on simple methods for the everyday display table needs (but power when you need it). Here is a brief example of how to use Great Tables to create a table from the included sp500 dataset:\nThere are 16 datasets provided by Great Tables: countrypops, sza, gtcars, sp500, pizzaplace, exibble, towny, peeps, films, metro, gibraltar, constants, illness, reactions, photolysis, and nuclides.\nAll of this tabular data is great for experimenting with the functionality available inside Great Tables and we make extensive use of these datasets in our documentation.\nBeyond the methods shown in the simple sp500-based example, there are many possible ways to create super-customized tables. Check out the documentation website to get started via introductory articles for making Great Tables. There’s a handy Reference section that has detailed help for every method and function in the package.\nLet’s talk about how to make Great Tables! There are a few locations where there is much potential for discussion.\nOne such place is in GitHub Discussions. This discussion board is especially great for Q&A, and many people have had their problems solved in there.\nAnother fine venue for discussion is in our Discord server. This is a good option for asking about the development of Great Tables, pitching ideas that may become features, and sharing your table creations!\nFinally, there is the X account. There you’ll find tweets about Great Tables (including sneak previews about in-development features) and other table-generation packages.\nThese are all great places to ask questions about how to use the package, discuss some ideas, engage with others, and much more!"

    "text": "We’ve spent a lot of time thinking about tables. Tables—like plots—are crucial as a last step toward presenting information. There is surprising sophistication and nuance in designing effective tables. Over the past 5,000 years, they’ve evolved from simple grids to highly structured displays of data. Although we argue that the mid-1900s served as a high point, the popularization and wider accessibility of computing seemingly brought us back to the simple, ancient times.\nOkay, it’s not all that bad but the workers of data are today confronted with an all-too-familiar dilemma: copy your data into a tool like Excel to make the table, or, display an otherwise unpolished table. Through the exploration of the qualities that make tables shine, the backstory of tables as a display of data, and the issues faced today, it’s clear how we can solve the great table dilemma with Great Tables.\nTables made with computers (left to right): (1) a DataFrame printed at the console, (2) an Excel table, and (3) a Great Tables table."

This is definitely a killer feature when working with pivoted operations.\nThe mask= parameter acts as a syntactic sugar, streamlining the process and removing the need to loop through columns manually.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarningUsing mask= Independently\n\n\n\n\n\nmask= should not be used in combination with the columns or rows arguments.

A special thanks to @henryharbeck for providing the second approach.\nWe hope you enjoy this new functionality as much as we do! Have ideas to make Great Tables even better? Share them with us via GitHub Issues. We’re always amazed by the creativity of our users! See you, until the next great table."

    "title": "Great Tables v0.3.0: So Many Style Options!",
    "section": "",
    "text": "As our work on Great Tables continues, we want you to be able to produce increasingly sophisticated tables. The look of an HTML table really matters and we believe aesthetics can elevate the presentation of tabular data. In the v0.3.0 release, we’ve implemented features that are concerned with modifying the visual aspects of a table. Let’s get down to what’s new in this version.\n\nModifying the widths of columns\nBefore v0.3.0, you could not alter the widths of individual columns. This meant that to great extent your content decided the width of individual columns. Even though browsers do an adequate job in sizing the widths of table columns, it doesn’t always result in a pleasing-to-look-at table. What if you want more space? Maybe you want consistently-sized columns? There’s many reasons to want to have a choice in the matter and the new cols_width() method now makes this possible.\nHere’s an example where the widths of all columns are set with our preferred length values (in px).\n\nimport warnings\nfrom great_tables import GT, exibble\n\nwarnings.filterwarnings(\"ignore\")\nexibble_mini = exibble[[\"num\", \"char\", \"date\", \"datetime\", \"row\"]].head(5)\n\n(\n    GT(exibble_mini).cols_width(\n        cases={\n            \"num\": \"30px\",\n            \"char\": \"100px\",\n            \"date\": \"150px\",\n            \"datetime\": \"200px\",\n            \"row\": \"50px\"\n        }\n    )\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n  num\n  char\n  date\n  datetime\n  row\n\n\n\n  \n    0.1111\n    apricot\n    2015-01-15\n    2018-01-01 02:22\n    row_1\n  \n  \n    2.222\n    banana\n    2015-02-15\n    2018-02-02 14:33\n    row_2\n  \n  \n    33.33\n    coconut\n    2015-03-15\n    2018-03-03 03:44\n    row_3\n  \n  \n    444.4\n    durian\n    2015-04-15\n    2018-04-04 15:55\n    row_4\n  \n  \n    5550.0\n    \n    2015-05-15\n    2018-05-05 04:00\n    row_5\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n        \n\n\nYou don’t have to define widths for all columns with cols_width(), and you’re free to use either px or % values when defining widths. See the reference page for more information and relevant examples.\n\n\nSetting options across the entire table with tab_options()\nThe new tab_options() method gives you the freedom to specify any of dozens of global style and layout options for the table. Want a font that’s used across all cells? Use the table_font_names= option. Do you need to make the text smaller, but only in the stub? Use stub_font_size= for that. The number of options is perhaps overwhelming at first but we think you’ll enjoy having them around nonetheless. It makes styling the table (and developing your own table themes) a relatively simple task.\nHere’s an example that creates a table with a few common components and then uses tab_options() to set up a collection of fonts for the table with the (also new) system_fonts() function:\n\nfrom great_tables import md, system_fonts\n\ngt_tbl = (\n    GT(\n        exibble[[\"num\", \"char\", \"currency\", \"row\", \"group\"]],\n        rowname_col=\"row\",\n        groupname_col=\"group\",\n    )\n    .tab_header(\n        title=md(\"Data listing from **exibble**\"),\n        subtitle=md(\"`exibble` is a **Great Tables** dataset.\"),\n    )\n    .fmt_number(columns=\"num\")\n    .fmt_currency(columns=\"currency\")\n    .tab_source_note(source_note=\"This is only a subset of the dataset.\")\n)\n\ngt_tbl.tab_options(table_font_names=system_fonts(name=\"industrial\"))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n    Data listing from exibble\n  \n  \n    exibble is a Great Tables dataset.\n  \n\n  \n  num\n  char\n  currency\n\n\n\n  \n    grp_a\n  \n  \n    row_1\n    0.11\n    apricot\n    $49.95\n  \n  \n    row_2\n    2.22\n    banana\n    $17.95\n  \n  \n    row_3\n    33.33\n    coconut\n    $1.39\n  \n  \n    row_4\n    444.40\n    durian\n    $65,100.00\n  \n  \n    grp_b\n  \n  \n    row_5\n    5,550.00\n    \n    $1,325.81\n  \n  \n    row_6\n    \n    fig\n    $13.26\n  \n  \n    row_7\n    777,000.00\n    grapefruit\n    \n  \n  \n    row_8\n    8,880,000.00\n    honeydew\n    $0.44\n  \n\n  \n  \n  \n    This is only a subset of the dataset.\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n        \n\n\nNote that table_font_names= accepts a list of fonts that operate as fallbacks for users across different systems (i.e., they may not have the font you have). And the system_fonts() helper function in Great Tables makes this easy by providing you with themed, local font stacks that are meant to work across different computing platforms.\nHere’s another example where we set the width of the table to span across the entire page (or containing element).\n\ngt_tbl.tab_options(table_width=\"100%\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n    Data listing from exibble\n  \n  \n    exibble is a Great Tables dataset.\n  \n\n  \n  num\n  char\n  currency\n\n\n\n  \n    grp_a\n  \n  \n    row_1\n    0.11\n    apricot\n    $49.95\n  \n  \n    row_2\n    2.22\n    banana\n    $17.95\n  \n  \n    row_3\n    33.33\n    coconut\n    $1.39\n  \n  \n    row_4\n    444.40\n    durian\n    $65,100.00\n  \n  \n    grp_b\n  \n  \n    row_5\n    5,550.00\n    \n    $1,325.81\n  \n  \n    row_6\n    \n    fig\n    $13.26\n  \n  \n    row_7\n    777,000.00\n    grapefruit\n    \n  \n  \n    row_8\n    8,880,000.00\n    honeydew\n    $0.44\n  \n\n  \n  \n  \n    This is only a subset of the dataset.\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n        \n\n\nOne more where the background color of the table is set to \"lightcyan\":\n\ngt_tbl.tab_options(table_background_color=\"lightcyan\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n    Data listing from exibble\n  \n  \n    exibble is a Great Tables dataset.\n  \n\n  \n  num\n  char\n  currency\n\n\n\n  \n    grp_a\n  \n  \n    row_1\n    0.11\n    apricot\n    $49.95\n  \n  \n    row_2\n    2.22\n    banana\n    $17.95\n  \n  \n    row_3\n    33.33\n    coconut\n    $1.39\n  \n  \n    row_4\n    444.40\n    durian\n    $65,100.00\n  \n  \n    grp_b\n  \n  \n    row_5\n    5,550.00\n    \n    $1,325.81\n  \n  \n    row_6\n    \n    fig\n    $13.26\n  \n  \n    row_7\n    777,000.00\n    grapefruit\n    \n  \n  \n    row_8\n    8,880,000.00\n    honeydew\n    $0.44\n  \n\n  \n  \n  \n    This is only a subset of the dataset.\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n        \n\n\nThere are many more options available in tab_options(), so have a look at its reference page for more information and useful examples.\n\n\nUsing the new opt_*() methods to do more complex tasks with table options\nWhile tab_options() is a great method for setting global table options, sometimes you want to set a number of them at once for a combined effect. For that type of operation, we have the opt_*() series of methods. A common thing you might do is align the content in the table header, we can make that an easy thing with opt_align_table_header():\n\ngt_tbl.opt_align_table_header(align=\"left\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n    Data listing from exibble\n  \n  \n    exibble is a Great Tables dataset.\n  \n\n  \n  num\n  char\n  currency\n\n\n\n  \n    grp_a\n  \n  \n    row_1\n    0.11\n    apricot\n    $49.95\n  \n  \n    row_2\n    2.22\n    banana\n    $17.95\n  \n  \n    row_3\n    33.33\n    coconut\n    $1.39\n  \n  \n    row_4\n    444.40\n    durian\n    $65,100.00\n  \n  \n    grp_b\n  \n  \n    row_5\n    5,550.00\n    \n    $1,325.81\n  \n  \n    row_6\n    \n    fig\n    $13.26\n  \n  \n    row_7\n    777,000.00\n    grapefruit\n    \n  \n  \n    row_8\n    8,880,000.00\n    honeydew\n    $0.44\n  \n\n  \n  \n  \n    This is only a subset of the dataset.\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n        \n\n\nWith that, you don’t have to hunt through the myriad options within tab_options() to find the two args you need to get the job done.\nThe opt_all_caps() method transforms the text within the column labels, the stub, and in all row groups so that we get an all-capitalized (yet somewhat sized down) look that better differentiates the labels from the data. It’s rather easy to use, just do this:\n\ngt_tbl.opt_all_caps()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n    Data listing from exibble\n  \n  \n    exibble is a Great Tables dataset.\n  \n\n  \n  num\n  char\n  currency\n\n\n\n  \n    grp_a\n  \n  \n    row_1\n    0.11\n    apricot\n    $49.95\n  \n  \n    row_2\n    2.22\n    banana\n    $17.95\n  \n  \n    row_3\n    33.33\n    coconut\n    $1.39\n  \n  \n    row_4\n    444.40\n    durian\n    $65,100.00\n  \n  \n    grp_b\n  \n  \n    row_5\n    5,550.00\n    \n    $1,325.81\n  \n  \n    row_6\n    \n    fig\n    $13.26\n  \n  \n    row_7\n    777,000.00\n    grapefruit\n    \n  \n  \n    row_8\n    8,880,000.00\n    honeydew\n    $0.44\n  \n\n  \n  \n  \n    This is only a subset of the dataset.\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n        \n\n\nThis sets nine options you’d otherwise set in tab_options() all at once, making life generally easier.\nHere’s one last example, this time using opt_vertical_padding(). You’d use that if you’re dissatisfied with the level of top/bottom padding within cells of all locations (e.g., in the table body, in the column labels, etc.). You can either make a table taller or more ‘compressed’ with a single argument: scale=. Here’s an example where the amount of vertical padding is reduced, resulting in a table taking up less vertical space.\n\ngt_tbl.opt_vertical_padding(scale=0.5)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n    Data listing from exibble\n  \n  \n    exibble is a Great Tables dataset.\n  \n\n  \n  num\n  char\n  currency\n\n\n\n  \n    grp_a\n  \n  \n    row_1\n    0.11\n    apricot\n    $49.95\n  \n  \n    row_2\n    2.22\n    banana\n    $17.95\n  \n  \n    row_3\n    33.33\n    coconut\n    $1.39\n  \n  \n    row_4\n    444.40\n    durian\n    $65,100.00\n  \n  \n    grp_b\n  \n  \n    row_5\n    5,550.00\n    \n    $1,325.81\n  \n  \n    row_6\n    \n    fig\n    $13.26\n  \n  \n    row_7\n    777,000.00\n    grapefruit\n    \n  \n  \n    row_8\n    8,880,000.00\n    honeydew\n    $0.44\n  \n\n  \n  \n  \n    This is only a subset of the dataset.\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n        \n\n\nWe have the following methods available in the opt_*() family\n\nopt_align_table_header()\nopt_all_caps()\nopt_vertical_padding()\nopt_horizontal_padding()\n\nand we plan to add more opt_*() methods in future releases.\n\n\nA new formatting method: fmt_image()\nWouldn’t it be great to add graphics to your table? The fmt_image() method provides an easy way to add image files on disk into table body cells. The cells need to contain some reference to an image file. The path= and file_pattern= arguments give you some flexibility in defining exactly where the image files live.\nHere’s an example using the metro dataset that’s included within Great Tables.\n\nfrom great_tables.data import metro\nfrom importlib_resources import files\n\nimg_paths = files(\"great_tables\") / \"data/metro_images\"\nmetro_mini = metro[[\"name\", \"lines\", \"passengers\"]].head(5)\n\n(\n    GT(metro_mini)\n    .fmt_image(columns=\"lines\", path=img_paths, file_pattern=\"metro_{}.svg\")\n    .fmt_integer(columns=\"passengers\")\n    .cols_label(\n        name=\"Station\",\n        lines=\"Metro Lines\",\n        passengers=\"Passengers per Year (2021)\"\n    )\n    .tab_options(table_width=\"700px\")\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  Station\n  Metro Lines\n  Passengers per Year (2021)\n\n\n\n  \n    Argentine\n    \n    2,079,212\n  \n  \n    Bastille\n      \n    8,069,243\n  \n  \n    Bérault\n    \n    2,106,827\n  \n  \n    Champs-Élysées—Clemenceau\n     \n    1,909,005\n  \n  \n    Charles de Gaulle—Étoile\n      \n    4,291,663\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n        \n\n\nNotice that path=img_paths specified the folder the images live in, and file_pattern=\"metro_{}.svg\" provided a template for converting each value in the lines column to an SVG file name.\nThe fmt_image() method supports three kinds of files as inputs, either: (1) complete http/https or local paths to the files; (2) the file names, where a common path can be provided via the path= arg; or (3) a fragment of the file name, as shown in the example above.\nThe package has some graphics stored in the data/metro_images directory. They are SVGs and they look very nice in the example table!\nSee the fmt_image() reference page for more information on this new method.\n\n\nWrapping up\nThis v0.3.0 release has some great new methods that add value to most any table-making endeavor. We also fixed a few bugs along the way so that you’ll have a overall smoother experience when building beautiful tables. As ever, we’ll work toward more and more improvements to give you more creative possibilities!"

    "text": "The development of Great Tables is really moving along these days. We just released version 0.15.0 and it adds quite a few nice things to the package. The features we’ll highlight in this post are:\n\nadding flag icons with the new fmt_flag() method\npeppering your table cells with Font Awesome icons via fmt_icon()\nsupport for displaying accounting notation with four number-based formatting methods\n\nLet’s look at each of these in turn!\n\nUsing fmt_flag() to incorporate country flag icons\nWhen tables contain country-level data, having a more visual representation for a country can help the reader more quickly parse the table contents. The new fmt_flag() method makes this easy to accomplish. You just need to have either two-letter country codes or three-letter country codes in a column.\nHere’s an example where country flags, shown as simplified circular icons, can be added to a table with fmt_flag():\n\nfrom great_tables import GT\nfrom great_tables.data import peeps\nimport polars as pl\n\npeeps_mini = (\n    pl.from_pandas(peeps)\n    .filter(pl.col(\"dob\").str.slice(offset=0, length=4) == \"1988\")\n    .with_columns(name=pl.col(\"name_given\") + \" \" + pl.col(\"name_family\"))\n    .fill_null(value=\"\")\n    .select([\"country\", \"name\", \"address\", \"city\", \"state_prov\", \"postcode\"])\n)\n\n(\n    GT(peeps_mini)\n    .tab_header(title=\"Our Contacts (Born in 1988)\")\n    .fmt_flag(columns=\"country\")\n    .opt_vertical_padding(scale=0.5)\n    .cols_label(\n        country=\"\",\n        name=\"Name\",\n        address=\"Address\",\n        city=\"City\",\n        state_prov=\"State/Prov.\",\n        postcode=\"Zip/Postcode\",\n    )\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n    Our Contacts (Born in 1988)\n  \n\n  \n  Name\n  Address\n  City\n  State/Prov.\n  Zip/Postcode\n\n\n\n  \n    United States\n    Martin Bartůněk\n    1850 Valley Lane\n    Austin\n    TX\n    78744\n  \n  \n    Slovenia\n    Feride Šijan\n    Tavcarjeva 58\n    Sodražica\n    \n    1317\n  \n  \n    Slovenia\n    Vejsil Crevar\n    Gosposka ulica 60\n    Novo mesto\n    \n    8501\n  \n  \n    Canada\n    Matilda Bates\n    582 Islington Ave\n    Toronto\n    ON\n    M8V 3B6\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n        \n\n\nThis slice of the peeps dataset has country codes in their 3-letter form (i.e., \"USA\", \"SVN\", and \"CAN\") within the country column. So long as they are correct, fmt_flag() will perform the conversion to flag icons. Also, there’s a little bit of interactivity here: when hovering over a flag, the country name will appear as a tooltip!\nWe have the power to display multiple flag icons within a single cell. To make this happen, the country codes need to be combined in a single string where each code is separated by a comma (e.g., \"US,DE,GB\"). Here’s an example that uses a portion of the films dataset:\n\nfrom great_tables import GT, google_font\nfrom great_tables.data import films\nimport polars as pl\n\nfilms_mini = (\n    pl.from_pandas(films)\n    .filter(pl.col(\"director\") == \"Michael Haneke\")\n    .with_columns(title=pl.col(\"title\") + \" (\" + pl.col(\"year\").cast(pl.String) + \")\")\n    .select([\"title\", \"run_time\", \"countries_of_origin\"])\n)\n\n(\n    GT(films_mini)\n    .fmt_flag(columns=\"countries_of_origin\")\n    .tab_header(title=\"In Competition Films by Michael Haneke\")\n    .opt_stylize()\n    .tab_options(column_labels_hidden=True)\n    .opt_table_font(font=google_font(\"PT Sans\"))\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n    In Competition Films by Michael Haneke\n  \n\n\n\n  \n    Funny Games (1997)\n    1h 48m\n    Austria\n  \n  \n    Code Unknown (2000)\n    1h 58m\n    France Austria Romania Germany\n  \n  \n    The Piano Teacher (2001)\n    2h 11m\n    France Austria Germany\n  \n  \n    Caché (2005)\n    1h 57m\n    France Austria Germany Italy\n  \n  \n    The White Ribbon (2009)\n    2h 24m\n    Germany Austria France Italy Canada\n  \n  \n    Amour (2012)\n    2h 7m\n    Austria France Germany\n  \n  \n    Happy End (2017)\n    1h 47m\n    France Austria Germany\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n        \n\n\nThe column countries_of_origin has these combined strings for each of the co-production films, where countries are arranged by decreasing level of contribution (e.g., \"FR,AT,RO,DE\" in the second row). The fmt_flag() method parses these strings into a sequence of flag icons that are displayed in the order provided. Each of the flags is separated by a space character but you can always change that default separator with the sep= argument.\n\n\nUsing fmt_icon() to include Font Awesome icons\nThe new fmt_icon() method gives you the ability to easily include Font Awesome icons in a table. It uses a similar input/output scheme as with fmt_flag(): provide the short icon name (e.g., \"table\", \"music\", \"globe\", etc.) or a comma-separated list of them, and fmt_icon() will provide the Font Awesome icon in place. Let’s see it in action with an example that uses the metro dataset:\n\nfrom great_tables import GT\nfrom great_tables.data import metro\nimport polars as pl\n\nmetro_mini = (\n    pl.from_pandas(metro).tail(10)\n    .with_columns(\n        services = (\n            pl.when(pl.col(\"connect_tramway\").is_not_null())\n            .then(pl.lit(\"train, train-tram\"))\n            .otherwise(pl.lit(\"train\"))\n        )\n    )\n    .select([\"name\", \"services\", \"location\"])\n)\n\n(\n    GT(metro_mini)\n    .tab_header(\"Services Available at Select Stations\")\n    .fmt_icon(columns=\"services\", sep=\" / \")\n    .tab_options(column_labels_hidden=True)\n    .opt_stylize(color=\"green\")\n    .opt_horizontal_padding(scale=3)\n    .opt_align_table_header(align=\"left\")\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n    Services Available at Select Stations\n  \n\n\n\n  \n    Porte de Vanves\n       /   \n    Paris 14th\n  \n  \n    Saint-Denis—Porte de Paris\n       /   \n    Saint-Denis\n  \n  \n    Saint-Denis—Université\n       /   \n    Saint-Denis\n  \n  \n    Saint-François-Xavier\n      \n    Paris 7th\n  \n  \n    Varenne\n      \n    Paris 7th\n  \n  \n    Bibliothèque François Mitterrand\n       /   \n    Paris 13th\n  \n  \n    Cour Saint-Émilion\n      \n    Paris 12th\n  \n  \n    Olympiades\n      \n    Paris 13th\n  \n  \n    Pont Cardinet\n      \n    Paris 17th\n  \n  \n    Saint-Ouen\n      \n    Clichy, Saint-Ouen-sur-Seine\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n        \n\n\nIn the code, we added in the icon names \"train\" and \"train-tram\" to the services column, and there could either be just the train icon or the pair that includes the tramway service. We wanted a little separation between the icons in the latter case, so sep=\" / \" was used to place a slash with spacing between any pair of icons. The icons appear here with a black fill color, but that can be changed with the fill_color= argument (and there are several other arguments for controlling style attributes).\nFor a list of available icons, their names, and what they look like, check out this listing on the Font Awesome website. The icons draw from the Font Awesome ‘free’ set (2000+ icons in total) but are not obtained via the web. Rather, we use the faicons library so that this can be done entirely offline (directly using the SVG icons stored within faicons).\n\n\nAccounting notation in select numeric formatting methods\nFor certain types of tables, it may be preferable to use accounting notation for numerical figures. This type of notation renders negative values in parentheses while omitting the minus sign. This is often seen for monetary and percentage figures but it’s also sensible for plain numbers in the right context. We’ve added support for accounting notation in four formatting methods:\n\nfmt_number()\nfmt_integer()\nfmt_currency()\nfmt_percent()\n\nHere’s a comprehensive example table that demonstrates how this type of formatting looks.\n\n\nShow the code\nfrom great_tables import GT\nimport polars as pl\n\ndf = pl.DataFrame({\n    \"number_type\": [\"negative\", \"positive\"],\n    \"number\": [-1.2, 23.6],\n    \"integer\": [-2323, 23213],\n    \"currency\": [-24334.23, 7323.253],\n    \"percent\": [-0.0523, 0.363]\n    }\n).with_columns(\n    number_acc = pl.col(\"number\"),\n    integer_acc = pl.col(\"integer\"),\n    currency_acc = pl.col(\"currency\"),\n    percent_acc = pl.col(\"percent\")\n)\n\n(\n    GT(df, rowname_col=\"number_type\")\n    .fmt_number(columns=\"number\")\n    .fmt_percent(columns=\"percent\")\n    .fmt_integer(columns=\"integer\")\n    .fmt_currency(columns=\"currency\")\n    .fmt_number(columns=\"number_acc\", accounting=True)\n    .fmt_percent(columns=\"percent_acc\", accounting=True)\n    .fmt_integer(columns=\"integer_acc\", accounting=True)\n    .fmt_currency(columns=\"currency_acc\", accounting=True)\n    .tab_spanner(label=\"default formatting\", columns=[1, 2, 3, 4])\n    .tab_spanner(label=\"with accounting notation\", columns=[5, 6, 7, 8])\n    .cols_label(\n        number_acc=\"number\",\n        integer_acc=\"integer\",\n        currency_acc=\"currency\",\n        percent_acc=\"percent\"\n    )\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n    default formatting\n  \n  \n    with accounting notation\n  \n\n\n  number\n  integer\n  currency\n  percent\n  number\n  integer\n  currency\n  percent\n\n\n\n  \n    negative\n    −1.20\n    −2,323\n    −$24,334.23\n    −5.23%\n    (1.20)\n    (2,323)\n    ($24,334.23)\n    (5.23%)\n  \n  \n    positive\n    23.60\n    23,213\n    $7,323.25\n    36.30%\n    23.60\n    23,213\n    $7,323.25\n    36.30%\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n        \n\n\nFor the formatting in the final four columns, we use accounting=True to get the values into accounting notation. This is only apparent for the negative values (first row) as the positive values won’t change their appearance, looking the same as they do when accounting=False (the default).\n\n\nAcknowledgements and how to contact us\nWe are very grateful for the work that Jerry Wu has done during this release, some of which includes:\n\nenhancing the fmt_image() to support http/https schema in the columns= parameter, and writing an incredible blog post about incorporating images in your tables\nimproving the save() method, giving it the ability to perform intermediate saves (since the method returns itself)\nadding the pipe() method, which operates similarly to that of the Pandas and Polars APIs\nall sorts of little QoL fixes\n\nWe extend our gratitude also to Alessandro Molina for adding experimental support for pyarrow.Table inputs in this release.\nFinally, we thank Luke Manley and Guillaume Lemaitre for their first contributions to the project!\nWe’re always happy to get feedback. There are three good ways to talk to us:\n\nGitHub Issues\nGitHub Discussions\nDiscord\n\nDon’t be shy. We love talking tables (and how we can make them better)!"

    "text": "Unit and scientific notation\nWe added the reactions dataset to serve as the basis for examples in the discipline of Atmospheric Chemistry. The dataset contains reaction rate constants for gas-phase reactions of 1,683 organic compounds. Each of these compounds can potentially undergo reaction with hydroxyl radicals (OH), nitrate radicals (NO3), or chlorine atoms (Cl). These reaction rate constants are typically very small values in units of cm3 molecules–1 s–1. In the upcoming example, we’ll pare down this massive dataset to only 11 rows representing the class of organic compounds known as mercaptans.\nTo make this table work well in a scientific reporting context, we need three pieces:\n\nway to represent units, like cm3\nmethod for typesetting chemical formulae, as in CH4\nformatting for very small numbers in scientific notation.\n\nGreat Tables provides the necessary functionality for all three requirements. Here is a summary table that tabulates rate constants for mercaptan compounds undergoing reaction with OH, O3, and Cl:\n\n\nShow the Code\nfrom great_tables import GT\nfrom great_tables.data import reactions\nimport polars as pl\nimport polars.selectors as ps\n\nreactions_mini = (\n    pl.from_pandas(reactions)\n    .filter(pl.col(\"cmpd_type\") == \"mercaptan\")\n    .select([\n        \"cmpd_name\",\n        \"cmpd_formula\",\n        ps.ends_with(\"k298\")\n    ])\n    .with_columns(\n        cmpd_formula=pl.concat_str(\n            \"%\" + pl.col(\"cmpd_formula\") + \"%\"\n        )\n    )\n)\n\n(\n    GT(reactions_mini, rowname_col=\"cmpd_name\")\n    .tab_header(title=\"Gas-phase reactions of selected mercaptan compounds\")\n    .tab_spanner(\n        columns=ps.ends_with(\"k298\"),\n        label=\"Reaction Rate Constant (298 K),&lt;br&gt;{{cm^3 molecules^–1 s^–1}}\"\n    )\n    .fmt_units(columns=\"cmpd_formula\")\n    .fmt_scientific(columns=ps.ends_with(\"k298\"))\n    .sub_missing()\n    .cols_hide(columns=\"O3_k298\")\n    .cols_label(\n        cmpd_formula=\"\",\n        OH_k298=\"OH\",\n        NO3_k298=\"{{%NO3%}}\",\n        Cl_k298=\"Cl\",\n    )\n    .opt_stylize(style=1, color=\"blue\")\n    .opt_horizontal_padding(scale=3)\n    .opt_table_font(stack=\"humanist\")\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n    Gas-phase reactions of selected mercaptan compounds\n  \n\n  \n  \n  \n    Reaction Rate Constant (298 K),cm3 molecules–1 s–1\n  \n\n\n  OH\n  NO3\n  Cl\n\n\n\n  \n    methanethiol\n    CH4S\n    3.50 × 10−11\n    9.20 × 10−13\n    2.00 × 10−10\n  \n  \n    ethanethiol\n    C2H6S\n    4.50 × 10−11\n    1.21 × 10−12\n    1.75 × 10−10\n  \n  \n    propanethiol\n    C3H8S\n    5.30 × 10−11\n    —\n    2.14 × 10−10\n  \n  \n    2-propanethiol\n    C3H8S\n    3.90 × 10−11\n    —\n    2.70 × 10−10\n  \n  \n    1-butanethiol\n    C4H10S\n    5.60 × 10−11\n    —\n    —\n  \n  \n    2-methyl-1-propanethiol\n    C4H10S\n    4.60 × 10−11\n    —\n    —\n  \n  \n    2-butanethiol\n    C4H10S\n    3.80 × 10−11\n    —\n    1.65 × 10−10\n  \n  \n    t-butylsulfide\n    C4H10S\n    2.90 × 10−11\n    —\n    —\n  \n  \n    2-methylbutanethiol\n    C5H12S\n    5.20 × 10−11\n    —\n    —\n  \n  \n    n-pentanethiol\n    C5H12S\n    —\n    —\n    1.97 × 10−10\n  \n  \n    1,2-ethanedithiol\n    C2H6S2\n    3.80 × 10−11\n    —\n    —\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n        \n\n\nThis is a nice-looking table! And note these pieces:\n\nThe label= argument to functions like .tab_spanner() supports the use of curly braces ({{/}}) for the specialized units notation. So using \"{{cm^3 molecules^–1 s^–1}}\" in the input will become cm3 molecules–1 s–1 in the output\nThe .fmt_units() method converts values that are already in units notation in the table body. For example, a cell with text \"%CH4S%\" becomes CH4S (the surrounding % indicates that the text should be interpreted as chemistry notation).\nThe .fmt_scientific() method formats values (in this case, very small values) to scientific notation (e.g., 3.50 × 10–11). Not doing so would make the table look very strange to a researcher that is familiar with this sort of data.\n\nThe combination of units notation (and chemistry notation, which is a part of that) really makes the presentation of this table complete and understandable to a practitioner of the field. Great Tables supports the use of units notation in spanner labels (with .tab_spanner()) and also in column labels (with .cols_labels()). The column label ‘NO3’ was created with the latter method by supplying the text \"{{%NO3%}}\" as the column label for the NO3_k298 column."

This approach brings together the advantages of plots (elucidation of trends in data) and tables (access to numerical values representing the data points) in a single summary visualization.\nVersion 0.10.0 of Great Tables adds the gibraltar dataset, which provides meteorological data (temeperature, humidity, wind speed, etc.) for the entire month of May 2024 at Gibraltar Airport Station.\nNanoplots, as mentioned, are great for condensing a lot of information into a small area.

One interesting observation that can be made from the table is that on May 9, 2023 there was a late-day temperature increase that coincided with a corresponding decrease in relative humidity. Making such an observation without nanoplots would be quite a bit more difficult and would require some serious determination, necessitating a careful scanning of numbers across a row cells.\nUnits notation is ever useful and it is applied in one of the column labels of this table. It could potentially be difficult to format even simple things like the units of temperature. In this case we wanted to add in the temperature units of °C for the temperature column. Units notation has a collection of symbols available, including \":degree:\" (colons encapsulate the collection of symbol keywords), for insertion within units notation text. The example takes advantage of the available symbols and so having °C as part of a label is not too hard to express."

    "section": "",
    "text": "In Great Tables 0.12.0 we focused on adding options for customizing the appearance of a table. In this post, we’ll present two new features:\n\nusing typefaces from Google Fonts via tab_style() and opt_table_font()\nadding table striping via tab_options() and opt_row_striping()\n\nLet’s have a look at how these new features can be used!\n\nUsing fonts from Google Fonts\nGoogle Fonts is a free service that allows use of hosted typefaces in your own websites. In Great Tables, we added the google_font() helper function to easily incorporate such fonts in your tables. There are two ways to go about this:\n\nuse google_font() with opt_table_font() to set a Google Font for the entire table\ninvoke google_font() within tab_style(styles=style.text(font=...)) to set the font within a location\n\nLet’s start with this small table that uses the default set of fonts for the entire table.\n\n\nShow the code\nfrom great_tables import GT, exibble, style, loc\n\ngt_tbl = (\n    GT(exibble.head(), rowname_col=\"row\", groupname_col=\"group\")\n    .cols_hide(columns=[\"char\", \"fctr\", \"date\", \"time\"])\n    .tab_header(\n        title=\"A small piece of the exibble dataset\",\n        subtitle=\"Displaying the first five rows (of eight)\",\n    )\n    .tab_source_note(\n        source_note=\"This dataset is included in Great Tables.\"\n    )\n)\n\ngt_tbl\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n    A small piece of the exibble dataset\n  \n  \n    Displaying the first five rows (of eight)\n  \n\n  \n  num\n  datetime\n  currency\n\n\n\n  \n    grp_a\n  \n  \n    row_1\n    0.1111\n    2018-01-01 02:22\n    49.95\n  \n  \n    row_2\n    2.222\n    2018-02-02 14:33\n    17.95\n  \n  \n    row_3\n    33.33\n    2018-03-03 03:44\n    1.39\n  \n  \n    row_4\n    444.4\n    2018-04-04 15:55\n    65100.0\n  \n  \n    grp_b\n  \n  \n    row_5\n    5550.0\n    2018-05-05 04:00\n    1325.81\n  \n\n  \n  \n  \n    This dataset is included in Great Tables.\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n        \n\n\nNow, with opt_table_font() + google_font(), we’ll change the table’s font to one from Google Fonts. I like Noto Serif so let’s use that here!\n\nfrom great_tables import GT, exibble, style, loc, google_font\n\n(\n    gt_tbl\n    .opt_table_font(font=google_font(name=\"Noto Serif\"))\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n    A small piece of the exibble dataset\n  \n  \n    Displaying the first five rows (of eight)\n  \n\n  \n  num\n  datetime\n  currency\n\n\n\n  \n    grp_a\n  \n  \n    row_1\n    0.1111\n    2018-01-01 02:22\n    49.95\n  \n  \n    row_2\n    2.222\n    2018-02-02 14:33\n    17.95\n  \n  \n    row_3\n    33.33\n    2018-03-03 03:44\n    1.39\n  \n  \n    row_4\n    444.4\n    2018-04-04 15:55\n    65100.0\n  \n  \n    grp_b\n  \n  \n    row_5\n    5550.0\n    2018-05-05 04:00\n    1325.81\n  \n\n  \n  \n  \n    This dataset is included in Great Tables.\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n        \n\n\nLooking good! And we don’t have to apply the font to the entire table. We might just wanted to use a Google Font in the table body. For that use case, tab_style() is the preferred method. Here’s an example that uses the IBM Plex Mono typeface.\n\n(\n    gt_tbl\n    .tab_style(\n        style=style.text(font=google_font(name=\"IBM Plex Mono\")),\n        locations=loc.body()\n    )\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n    A small piece of the exibble dataset\n  \n  \n    Displaying the first five rows (of eight)\n  \n\n  \n  num\n  datetime\n  currency\n\n\n\n  \n    grp_a\n  \n  \n    row_1\n    0.1111\n    2018-01-01 02:22\n    49.95\n  \n  \n    row_2\n    2.222\n    2018-02-02 14:33\n    17.95\n  \n  \n    row_3\n    33.33\n    2018-03-03 03:44\n    1.39\n  \n  \n    row_4\n    444.4\n    2018-04-04 15:55\n    65100.0\n  \n  \n    grp_b\n  \n  \n    row_5\n    5550.0\n    2018-05-05 04:00\n    1325.81\n  \n\n  \n  \n  \n    This dataset is included in Great Tables.\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n        \n\n\nNice! And it’s refreshing to see tables with fonts different from default set, as good as it might be. We kept the google_font() helper function as simple as possible, requiring only the font name in its name= argument. There are hundreds of fonts hosted on Google Fonts so look through the site, experiment, and find the fonts that you think look best in your tables!\n\n\nStriping rows in your table\nSome people like having row striping (a.k.a. zebra stripes) in their display tables. We also know that some advise against the practice. We understand it’s a controversial table issue, however, we also want to give you the creative freedom to just include the stripes. To that end, we now have that option in the package. There are two ways to enable this look:\n\ninvoking opt_row_striping() to quickly set row stripes in the table body\nusing some combination of three row_striping_* arguments in tab_options()\n\nLet’s use that example table with opt_row_striping().\n\ngt_tbl.opt_row_striping()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n    A small piece of the exibble dataset\n  \n  \n    Displaying the first five rows (of eight)\n  \n\n  \n  num\n  datetime\n  currency\n\n\n\n  \n    grp_a\n  \n  \n    row_1\n    0.1111\n    2018-01-01 02:22\n    49.95\n  \n  \n    row_2\n    2.222\n    2018-02-02 14:33\n    17.95\n  \n  \n    row_3\n    33.33\n    2018-03-03 03:44\n    1.39\n  \n  \n    row_4\n    444.4\n    2018-04-04 15:55\n    65100.0\n  \n  \n    grp_b\n  \n  \n    row_5\n    5550.0\n    2018-05-05 04:00\n    1325.81\n  \n\n  \n  \n  \n    This dataset is included in Great Tables.\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n        \n\n\nIt’s somewhat subtle but there is an alternating, slightly gray background (starting on the \"row_2\" row). The color is #808080 but with an alpha (transparency) value of 0.05.\nIf this is not exactly what you want, there is an alternative to this. The tab_options() method has three new arguments:\n\nrow_striping_background_color: color to use for row striping\nrow_striping_include_stub: should striping include cells in the stub?\nrow_striping_include_table_body: should striping include cells in the body?\n\nWith these new options, we can choose to stripe the entire row (stub cells + body cells) and use a darker color like \"lightblue\".\n\n(\n    gt_tbl\n    .tab_options(\n        row_striping_background_color=\"lightblue\",\n        row_striping_include_stub=True,\n        row_striping_include_table_body=True,\n    )\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n    A small piece of the exibble dataset\n  \n  \n    Displaying the first five rows (of eight)\n  \n\n  \n  num\n  datetime\n  currency\n\n\n\n  \n    grp_a\n  \n  \n    row_1\n    0.1111\n    2018-01-01 02:22\n    49.95\n  \n  \n    row_2\n    2.222\n    2018-02-02 14:33\n    17.95\n  \n  \n    row_3\n    33.33\n    2018-03-03 03:44\n    1.39\n  \n  \n    row_4\n    444.4\n    2018-04-04 15:55\n    65100.0\n  \n  \n    grp_b\n  \n  \n    row_5\n    5550.0\n    2018-05-05 04:00\n    1325.81\n  \n\n  \n  \n  \n    This dataset is included in Great Tables.\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n        \n\n\nThese alternating fills can be a good idea in some table display circumstances. Now, you can make that call and the functionality is there to support your decision.\n\n\nWrapping up\nWe are excited that this new functionality is now available in Great Tables. As ever, please let us know through GitHub Issues whether you ran into problems with any feature (new or old), or, if you have suggestions for further improvement!"

    "title": "Great Tables v0.18.0: Easy Column Spanners and More!",
    "section": "",
    "text": "The development of Great Tables continues! We’re excited to announce the release of v0.18.0, which brings several powerful new features. These features make it even easier to create beautiful, informative tables. The key additions in this release include new methods (and a tweak to an existing one):\n\n.tab_spanner_delim(): quick spanner creation\n.fmt_tf(): easy boolean value formatting\n.cols_label_rotate(): enables column label rotation\n.fmt_datetime(): added format_str= parameter for extra customization\n\nLet’s explore each of these interesting new features!\n\nQuick spanner creation with tab_spanner_delim()\nWorking with data that has hierarchical column names can be tedious when manually creating spanners. The new .tab_spanner_delim() method automates this process by intelligently splitting column names based on a delimiter and creating the appropriate spanner structure.\nHere’s a practical example using the towny dataset, which contains population data for a collection of municipalities across multiple census years. Let’s start by looking at the most populated cities and examining their column structure:\n\nfrom great_tables import GT\nfrom great_tables.data import towny\nimport polars as pl\nimport polars.selectors as cs\n\n# Create a smaller version of the `towny` dataset\ntowny_mini = (\n    pl.from_pandas(towny)\n    .filter(pl.col(\"csd_type\") == \"city\")\n    .sort(\"population_2021\", descending=True)\n    .select(\n        \"name\",\n        cs.starts_with(\"population_\"),\n        cs.starts_with(\"density_\")\n    )\n    .head(5)\n)\n\n# Let's look at the column names\nprint(towny_mini.columns)\n\n['name', 'population_1996', 'population_2001', 'population_2006', 'population_2011', 'population_2016', 'population_2021', 'density_1996', 'density_2001', 'density_2006', 'density_2011', 'density_2016', 'density_2021']\n\n\nNotice how the column names have a clear hierarchical structure with underscores as delimiters. Let’s now create a table that takes advantage of this structure:\n\n(\n    GT(towny_mini, rowname_col=\"name\")\n    .tab_spanner_delim(delim=\"_\")\n    .fmt_integer(columns=cs.contains(\"population\"))\n    .fmt_number(columns=cs.contains(\"density\"), decimals=1)\n    .tab_header(title=\"Population and Density Trends from Census Data\")\n    .opt_align_table_header(align=\"left\")\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n    Population and Density Trends from Census Data\n  \n\n  \n  \n    population\n  \n  \n    density\n  \n\n\n  1996\n  2001\n  2006\n  2011\n  2016\n  2021\n  1996\n  2001\n  2006\n  2011\n  2016\n  2021\n\n\n\n  \n    Toronto\n    2,385,421\n    2,481,494\n    2,503,281\n    2,615,060\n    2,731,571\n    2,794,356\n    3,779.8\n    3,932.0\n    3,966.5\n    4,143.6\n    4,328.3\n    4,427.8\n  \n  \n    Ottawa\n    721,136\n    774,072\n    812,129\n    883,391\n    934,243\n    1,017,449\n    258.6\n    277.6\n    291.3\n    316.8\n    335.1\n    364.9\n  \n  \n    Mississauga\n    544,382\n    612,925\n    668,599\n    713,443\n    721,599\n    717,961\n    1,859.6\n    2,093.8\n    2,283.9\n    2,437.1\n    2,465.0\n    2,452.6\n  \n  \n    Brampton\n    268,251\n    325,428\n    433,806\n    523,906\n    593,638\n    656,480\n    1,008.9\n    1,223.9\n    1,631.5\n    1,970.4\n    2,232.7\n    2,469.0\n  \n  \n    Hamilton\n    467,799\n    490,268\n    504,559\n    519,949\n    536,917\n    569,353\n    418.3\n    438.4\n    451.2\n    464.9\n    480.1\n    509.1\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n        \n\n\nThe .tab_spanner_delim() method recognizes the underscore delimiter and creates a hierarchical structure: \"population\" and \"density\" become top-level spanners, with the years (1996, 2001, 2021) as the final column labels. This creates a clean, organized appearance that clearly groups related metrics together. And, this one method can be used instead of a combination of .cols_label() and .tab_spanner() (which requires a separate invocation per spanner added).\n\n\nBeautiful boolean formatting with fmt_tf()\nBoolean data is common in analytical tables, but raw True/False values can look unprofessional. The new .fmt_tf() method provides elegant ways to display boolean data using symbols, words, or custom formatting.\nHere’s a simple example showing different tf_style= options:\n\nfrom great_tables import GT\nimport polars as pl\n\n# Create a simple DF with boolean data\nbool_df = pl.DataFrame({\n    \"feature\": [\"Premium Sound\", \"Leather Seats\", \"Sunroof\", \"Navigation\"],\n    \"model_a\": [True, False, True, True],\n    \"model_b\": [True, True, False, True],\n    \"model_c\": [False, True, True, False]\n})\n\n(\n    GT(bool_df, rowname_col=\"feature\")\n    .fmt_tf(tf_style=\"check-mark\", colors=[\"green\", \"red\"])\n    .tab_header(title=\"Car Features Comparison\", subtitle=\"Using check-mark style\")\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n    Car Features Comparison\n  \n  \n    Using check-mark style\n  \n\n  \n  model_a\n  model_b\n  model_c\n\n\n\n  \n    Premium Sound\n    ✔\n    ✔\n    ✘\n  \n  \n    Leather Seats\n    ✘\n    ✔\n    ✔\n  \n  \n    Sunroof\n    ✔\n    ✘\n    ✔\n  \n  \n    Navigation\n    ✔\n    ✔\n    ✘\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n        \n\n\nYou can also use different symbols and colors for a more distinctive look:\n\n(\n    GT(bool_df, rowname_col=\"feature\")\n    .fmt_tf(tf_style=\"circles\", colors=[\"#4CAF50\", \"#F44336\"])\n    .tab_header(title=\"Car Features Comparison\", subtitle=\"Using circles style\")\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n    Car Features Comparison\n  \n  \n    Using circles style\n  \n\n  \n  model_a\n  model_b\n  model_c\n\n\n\n  \n    Premium Sound\n    ●\n    ●\n    ⭘\n  \n  \n    Leather Seats\n    ⭘\n    ●\n    ●\n  \n  \n    Sunroof\n    ●\n    ⭘\n    ●\n  \n  \n    Navigation\n    ●\n    ●\n    ⭘\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n        \n\n\nThe .fmt_tf() method transforms boolean values into visually appealing symbols that make it easy to quickly scan and compare data across rows and columns.\n\n\nRotating column labels with cols_label_rotate()\nWhen dealing with many columns or long column names, horizontal space becomes precious. The .cols_label_rotate() method solves this by rotating column labels vertically, allowing for more compact table layouts.\nHere’s an example where we use the gtcars dataset to create a table which communicates a feature matrix:\n\nfrom great_tables import GT, style, loc\nfrom great_tables.data import gtcars\nimport polars as pl\nimport polars.selectors as cs\n\n# Manipulate dataset to create a feature comparison table\ngtcars_mini = (\n    pl.from_pandas(gtcars)\n    .filter(pl.col(\"year\") == 2017)\n    .filter(pl.col(\"ctry_origin\").is_in([\"Germany\", \"Italy\", \"United Kingdom\"]))\n    .with_columns([\n        (pl.col(\"hp\") &gt; 500).alias(\"High Power\"),\n        (pl.col(\"mpg_h\") &gt; 25).alias(\"Fuel Efficient\"),\n        (pl.col(\"drivetrain\") == \"awd\").alias(\"All Wheel Drive\"),\n        (pl.col(\"msrp\") &gt; 100000).alias(\"Premium Price\"),\n        (pl.col(\"trsmn\").str.contains(\"manual\")).alias(\"Manual Transmission\")\n    ])\n    .select([\n        \"mfr\", \"model\", \"trim\",\n        \"High Power\",\n        \"Fuel Efficient\",\n        \"All Wheel Drive\",\n        \"Premium Price\",\n        \"Manual Transmission\"\n    ])\n    .head(10)\n)\n\n(\n    GT(gtcars_mini)\n    .fmt_tf(\n        columns=cs.by_dtype(pl.Boolean),\n        tf_style=\"check-mark\",\n        colors=[\"#2E8B57\", \"#DC143C\"]\n    )\n    .cols_label_rotate(\n        columns=cs.by_dtype(pl.Boolean),\n        dir=\"sideways-lr\"\n    )\n    .tab_header(\n        title=\"European Luxury Cars Feature Matrix\",\n        subtitle=\"2017 Models with Performance & Luxury Features\"\n    )\n    .opt_stylize(style=1)\n    .tab_style(\n        style=style.text(size=\"11px\"),\n        locations=loc.body()\n    )\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n    European Luxury Cars Feature Matrix\n  \n  \n    2017 Models with Performance & Luxury Features\n  \n\n  mfr\n  model\n  trim\n  High Power\n  Fuel Efficient\n  All Wheel Drive\n  Premium Price\n  Manual Transmission\n\n\n\n  \n    Ferrari\n    GTC4Lusso\n    Base Coupe\n    ✔\n    ✘\n    ✔\n    ✔\n    ✘\n  \n  \n    Aston Martin\n    DB11\n    Base Coupe\n    ✔\n    ✘\n    ✘\n    ✔\n    ✘\n  \n  \n    Lotus\n    Evora\n    2+2 Coupe\n    ✘\n    ✘\n    ✘\n    ✘\n    ✘\n  \n  \n    Porsche\n    718 Boxster\n    Base Convertible\n    ✘\n    ✔\n    ✘\n    ✘\n    ✘\n  \n  \n    Porsche\n    718 Cayman\n    Base Coupe\n    ✘\n    ✔\n    ✘\n    ✘\n    ✘\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n        \n\n\nThis example demonstrates how both the .fmt_tf() and .cols_label_rotate() methods can work well together. The boolean columns use checkmarks (✓/✗) with custom colors=, while the rotated labels save horizontal space in this dense feature matrix. The combination allows you to put more information into a compact and still readable format.\n\n\nEnhanced datetime formatting with fmt_datetime()\nThe .fmt_datetime() method now supports custom format strings through the new format_str= parameter, giving you complete control over how datetime values appear in your tables.\nHere’s an example using the included gibraltar weather dataset:\n\nfrom great_tables import GT\nfrom great_tables.data import gibraltar\nimport polars as pl\n\n# Prepare the meteorological data\ngibraltar_mini = (\n    pl.from_pandas(gibraltar)\n    .with_columns(\n        [\n            pl.concat_str([pl.col(\"date\"), pl.lit(\" \"), pl.col(\"time\")])\n            .str.strptime(pl.Datetime, format=\"%Y-%m-%d %H:%M\")\n            .alias(\"datetime\")\n        ]\n    )\n    .filter(pl.col(\"datetime\").dt.hour().is_in([6, 12, 18]))\n    .select([\"datetime\", \"temp\", \"humidity\", \"condition\"])\n    .sort(\"datetime\")\n    .head(10)\n)\n\n(\n    GT(gibraltar_mini)\n    .fmt_datetime(\n        columns=\"datetime\",\n        format_str=\"%b %d %Y (%a) - %I:%M %p\",\n    )\n    .fmt_number(columns=\"temp\", decimals=1, pattern=\"{x}°C\")\n    .fmt_percent(columns=\"humidity\", scale_values=False, decimals=0)\n    .cols_label(\n        datetime=\"Time\",\n        temp=\"Temperature\",\n        humidity=\"Humidity\",\n        condition=\"Conditions\",\n    )\n    .tab_header(\n        title=\"Gibraltar Temperature and Humidity Conditions\",\n        subtitle=\"Morning, Noon, and Evening Readings\"\n    )\n    .opt_stylize(style=1, color=\"cyan\")\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n    Gibraltar Temperature and Humidity Conditions\n  \n  \n    Morning, Noon, and Evening Readings\n  \n\n  Time\n  Temperature\n  Humidity\n  Conditions\n\n\n\n  \n    May 01 2023 (Mon) - 06:50 AM\n    17.2°C\n    1%\n    Fair\n  \n  \n    May 01 2023 (Mon) - 12:20 PM\n    22.2°C\n    1%\n    Fair\n  \n  \n    May 01 2023 (Mon) - 12:50 PM\n    22.2°C\n    1%\n    Fair\n  \n  \n    May 01 2023 (Mon) - 06:20 PM\n    20.0°C\n    1%\n    Fair\n  \n  \n    May 01 2023 (Mon) - 06:50 PM\n    20.0°C\n    1%\n    Fair\n  \n  \n    May 02 2023 (Tue) - 06:50 AM\n    17.8°C\n    1%\n    Mostly Cloudy\n  \n  \n    May 02 2023 (Tue) - 12:20 PM\n    18.9°C\n    1%\n    Mostly Cloudy\n  \n  \n    May 02 2023 (Tue) - 12:50 PM\n    20.0°C\n    1%\n    Mostly Cloudy\n  \n  \n    May 02 2023 (Tue) - 06:20 PM\n    22.2°C\n    1%\n    Fair\n  \n  \n    May 02 2023 (Tue) - 06:50 PM\n    22.2°C\n    1%\n    Fair\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n        \n\n\nThe custom datetime formatting string in format_str=\"%b %d %Y (%a) - %I:%M %p\" creates a readable datetime format that’s perfect for weather reporting, showing the day of week, month, day, year, and the time in 12-hour format.\n\n\nAcknowledgements and what’s next\nWe’re grateful to all the contributors who made this release possible.

    "title": "Great Tables v0.2.0: Easy Data Coloring",
    "section": "",
    "text": "We enjoy working on Great Tables because we want everybody to easily make beautiful tables. Tables don’t have to be boring, they really could be captivating and insightful. With every release we get closer and closer to realizing our mission and, as such, we’re happy to announce the v0.2.0 release that’s now on PyPI.\nThe really big feature that’s available with this release is the data_color() method. It gives you several options for colorizing data cells based on the underlying data. The method automatically scales color values according to the data in order to emphasize differences or reveal trends. The example below emphasizes large currency values with a \"darkgreen\" fill color.\n\nfrom great_tables import GT, exibble\n\n(\n    GT(exibble[[\"currency\", \"date\", \"row\"]].head(4), rowname_col=\"row\")\n    .data_color(\n        columns=\"currency\",\n        palette=[\"lightblue\", \"darkgreen\"]\n    )\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  currency\n  date\n\n\n\n  \n    row_1\n    49.95\n    2015-01-15\n  \n  \n    row_2\n    17.95\n    2015-02-15\n  \n  \n    row_3\n    1.39\n    2015-03-15\n  \n  \n    row_4\n    65100.0\n    2015-04-15\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n        \n\n\nNote that we use columns= to specify which columns get the colorizing treatment (just currency here) and the palette= is given as a list of color values. From this we can see that the 65100.0 value polarizes the data coloring process; it is \"darkgreen\" while all other values are \"lightblue\" (with no interpolated colors in between). Also, isn’t it nice that the text adapts to the background color?\nThe above example is suitable for emphasizing large values, but, maybe you consider the extreme value to be something that’s out of bounds? For that, we can use the domain= and na_value= arguments to gray-out the extreme values. We’ll also nicely format the currency column in this next example.\n\n(\n    GT(exibble[[\"currency\", \"date\", \"row\"]].head(4), rowname_col=\"row\")\n    .data_color(\n        columns=\"currency\",\n        palette=[\"lightblue\", \"darkgreen\"],\n        domain=[0, 50],\n        na_color=\"lightgray\"\n    )\n    .fmt_currency(\n        columns=\"currency\",\n        currency=\"GBP\",\n        use_subunits=False\n    )\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  currency\n  date\n\n\n\n  \n    row_1\n    £50\n    2015-01-15\n  \n  \n    row_2\n    £18\n    2015-02-15\n  \n  \n    row_3\n    £1\n    2015-03-15\n  \n  \n    row_4\n    £65,100\n    2015-04-15\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n        \n\n\nNow the very large value is in \"lightgray\", making all other values easier to compare. We did setting domain=[0, 50] and specifying na_color=\"lightgray\". This caused the out-of-bounds value of 65100 to have a light gray background. Notice that the values are also formatted as currencies, and this is thanks to fmt_currency() which never interferes with styling.\nHere’s a more inspirational example that uses a heavily-manipulated version of the countrypops dataset (thanks again, Polars!) along with a color treatment that’s mediated by data_color(). Here, the population values can be easily compared by the amount of \"purple\" within them.\n\nfrom great_tables.data import countrypops\nimport polars as pl\nimport polars.selectors as cs\n\nwide_pops = (\n    pl.from_pandas(countrypops)\n    .filter(\n        pl.col(\"country_code_2\").is_in([\"FM\", \"GU\", \"KI\", \"MH\", \"MP\", \"NR\", \"PW\"])\n        & pl.col(\"year\").is_in([2000, 2010, 2020])\n    )\n    .pivot(index=\"country_name\", on=\"year\", values=\"population\")\n    .sort(\"2020\", descending=True)\n)\n\n(\n    GT(wide_pops, rowname_col=\"country_name\")\n    .tab_header(\n        title=\"Populations of Select Countries in Oceania\",\n        subtitle=\"Population values are from 2000, 2010, and 2020.\",\n    )\n    .tab_spanner(label=\"Total Population\", columns=cs.all())\n    .fmt_integer(columns=[\"2000\", \"2010\", \"2020\"])\n    .data_color(palette=[\"white\", \"purple\"], domain=[0, 1.7e5])\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n    Populations of Select Countries in Oceania\n  \n  \n    Population values are from 2000, 2010, and 2020.\n  \n\n  \n  \n    Total Population\n  \n\n\n  2000\n  2010\n  2020\n\n\n\n  \n    Guam\n    160,188\n    164,905\n    169,231\n  \n  \n    Kiribati\n    88,826\n    107,995\n    126,463\n  \n  \n    Micronesia (Federated States)\n    111,709\n    107,588\n    112,106\n  \n  \n    Northern Mariana Islands\n    80,338\n    54,087\n    49,587\n  \n  \n    Marshall Islands\n    54,224\n    53,416\n    43,413\n  \n  \n    Palau\n    19,726\n    18,540\n    17,972\n  \n  \n    Nauru\n    10,377\n    10,241\n    12,315\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n        \n\n\nThis was just a sampler of what you can do with the all-new data_color() method. Take a look at these pages for more information:\n\nThe Colorizing with Data page in the Get Started Guide, which provides more details on how to use data_color()\nThe guide on Basic Styling covers general styling (e.g., bold text, underlines, etc.) with tab_style()\nThe reference pages for data_color() and tab_style()\n\nTo conclude, we’re happy that this new functionality is now in the Great Tables package! We hope you find it useful for your table-generation work. And we’ll keep improving upon it so that you’ll have more possibilities to make beautiful, and colorful, tables for presentation."

    "section": "",
    "text": "The Great Tables package allows you to make tables, and they’re really great when part of a report, a book, or a web page. The API is meant to be easy to work with so DataFrames could be made into publication-quality tables without a lot of hassle. And having nice-looking tables in the mix elevates the quality of the medium you’re working in.\nWe were inspired by this and decided to explore what it could mean to introduce a package where reporting is largely in the form of beautiful tables. To this end, we started work on a new Python package that generates tables (c/o Great Tables) as reporting objects. This package is called Pointblank, its focus is that of data validation, and the reporting tables it can produce informs users on the results of a data validation workflow. In this post we’ll go through how Pointblank:\n\nenables you to validate many types of DataFrames and SQL databases\nprovides easy-to-understand validation result tables and thorough drilldowns\ngives you nice previews of data tables across a range of backends\n\n\nValidating data with Pointblank\nJust like Great Tables, Pointblank’s primary input is a table and the goal of that library is to perform checks of the tabular data. Other libraries in this domain include Great Expectations, pandera, Soda, and PyDeequ.\nBelow is the main validation report table that users are likely to see quite often. Each row is a validation step, with columns reporting details about each step and their results.\n\n\nShow the code\nimport pointblank as pb\n\nvalidation = (\n    pb.Validate(\n        data=pb.load_dataset(dataset=\"small_table\", tbl_type=\"polars\"),\n        label=\"An example validation\",\n        thresholds=(0.1, 0.2, 0.5),\n    )\n    .col_vals_gt(columns=\"d\", value=1000)\n    .col_vals_le(columns=\"c\", value=5)\n    .col_exists(columns=[\"date\", \"date_time\"])\n    .interrogate()\n)\n\nvalidation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n\n\n\n\n  \n    Pointblank Validation\n  \n  \n    An example validationPolarsWARN0.1STOP0.2NOTIFY0.5\n  \n\n  \n  \n  STEP\n  COLUMNS\n  VALUES\n  TBL\n  EVAL\n  UNITS\n  PASS\n  FAIL\n  W\n  S\n  N\n  EXT\n\n\n\n  \n    #CF142B\n    1\n    \n        \n        \n\n    col_vals_gt\n    \n        \n            \n            \n        \n    \n\n        \n         col_vals_gt()\n        \n    d\n    1000\n    \n    \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n    \n\n    ✓\n    13\n    70.54\n    60.46\n    ●\n    ●\n    ○\n    CSV\n  \n  \n    #CF142B\n    2\n    \n        \n        \n\n    col_vals_lte\n    \n        \n            \n            \n        \n    \n\n        \n         col_vals_le()\n        \n    c\n    5\n    \n    \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n    \n\n    ✓\n    13\n    50.38\n    80.62\n    ●\n    ●\n    ●\n    CSV\n  \n  \n    #4CA64C\n    3\n    \n        \n        \n\n    col_exists\n    \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n    \n\n        \n         col_exists()\n        \n    date\n    —\n    \n    \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n    \n\n    ✓\n    1\n    11.00\n    00.00\n    ○\n    ○\n    ○\n    —\n  \n  \n    #4CA64C\n    4\n    \n        \n        \n\n    col_exists\n    \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n    \n\n        \n         col_exists()\n        \n    date_time\n    —\n    \n    \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n    \n\n    ✓\n    1\n    11.00\n    00.00\n    ○\n    ○\n    ○\n    —\n  \n\n  \n  \n  \n    2025-02-11 17:51:12 UTC&lt; 1 s2025-02-11 17:51:12 UTC\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n        \n\n\nThe first validation step (cols_val_gt()) checks the d column in the data, to ensure each value is greater than 1000. Notice that the red bar on the left indicates it failed, and the FAIL column says it has 6 failing values out of 13 UNITS.\nThe table is chock full of the information you need when doing data validation tasks. And it’s also easy on the eyes. Some cool features include:\n\na header with information on the type of input table plus important validation options\nvertical color strips on the left side to indicate overall status of the rows\nicons in several columns (space saving and they let you know what’s up)\n‘CSV’ buttons that, when clicked, provide you with a CSV file\na footer with timing information for the analysis\n\nIt’s a nice table and it scales nicely to the large variety of validation types and options available in the Pointblank library. Viewing this table is a central part of using that library and the great thing about the reporting being a table like this is that it can be shared by placing it in a publication environment of your choosing (for example, it could be put in a Quarto document).\nHere is the code that was used to generate the data validation above:\n\nimport pointblank as pb\n\nvalidation = (\n    pb.Validate(\n        data=pb.load_dataset(dataset=\"small_table\", tbl_type=\"polars\"),\n        label=\"An example validation\",\n        thresholds=(0.1, 0.2, 0.5),\n    )\n    .col_vals_gt(columns=\"d\", value=1000)\n    .col_vals_le(columns=\"c\", value=5)\n    .col_exists(columns=[\"date\", \"date_time\"])\n    .interrogate()\n)\n\nvalidation\n\nPointblank makes it easy to get started by giving you a simple entry point (Validate()), allowing you to define as many validation steps as needed. Each validation step is specified by calling methods like .cols_vals_gt(), which is short for checking that “column values are greater than” some specified value.\nPointblank enables you to validate many types of DataFrames and SQL databases. Pointblank supports Pandas and Polars through Narwhals, and numerous backends (like DuckDB and MySQL) are also supported though our Ibis integration.\n\n\nExploring data validation failures\nNote that the above validation report table showed 6 failures in the first validation step. You might want to know exactly what failed, giving you a chance to fix the underlying data quality issues. To do that, you can use the get_step_report() method:\n\nvalidation.get_step_report(i=1)\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n\n\n\n\n  \n    Report for Validation Step 1\n  \n  \n    ASSERTION d &gt; 10006 / 13 TEST UNIT FAILURES IN COLUMN 6EXTRACT OF 6 ROWS WITH TEST UNIT FAILURES IN RED:\n  \n\n  \n  date_timeDatetime\n  dateDate\n  aInt64\n  bString\n  cInt64\n  dFloat64\n  eBoolean\n  fString\n\n\n\n  \n    5\n    2016-01-09 12:36:00\n    2016-01-09\n    8\n    3-ldm-038\n    7\n    283.94\n    True\n    low\n  \n  \n    7\n    2016-01-15 18:46:00\n    2016-01-15\n    7\n    1-knw-093\n    3\n    843.34\n    True\n    high\n  \n  \n    9\n    2016-01-20 04:30:00\n    2016-01-20\n    3\n    5-bce-642\n    9\n    837.93\n    False\n    high\n  \n  \n    10\n    2016-01-20 04:30:00\n    2016-01-20\n    3\n    5-bce-642\n    9\n    837.93\n    False\n    high\n  \n  \n    11\n    2016-01-26 20:07:00\n    2016-01-26\n    4\n    2-dmx-010\n    7\n    833.98\n    True\n    low\n  \n  \n    12\n    2016-01-28 02:51:00\n    2016-01-28\n    2\n    7-dmx-010\n    8\n    108.34\n    False\n    low\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n        \n\n\nThe use of a table for reporting is ideal here! The main features of this step report table include:\n\na header with summarized information\nthe selected rows that contain the failures\na highlighted column of interest\n\nDifferent types of validation methods will have step report tables that organize the pertinent information in a way that makes sense for the validation performed.\n\n\nPreviewing datasets across backends\nBecause many of the backends Pointblank supports have varying ways to view the underlying data, we provide a unified preview() function. It gives you a beautiful and consistent view of any data table. Here is how it looks against a 2,000 row DuckDB table that’s included in the package (game_revenue):\n\n\nShow the code\npb.preview(pb.load_dataset(dataset=\"game_revenue\", tbl_type=\"duckdb\"))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n\n\n\n\n  \n    DuckDBRows2,000Columns11\n  \n\n  \n  player_idstring\n  session_idstring\n  session_starttimestamp\n  timetimestamp\n  item_typestring\n  item_namestring\n  item_revenuefloat64\n  session_durationfloat64\n  start_daydate\n  acquisitionstring\n  countrystring\n\n\n\n  \n    1\n    ECPANOIXLZHF896\n    ECPANOIXLZHF896-eol2j8bs\n    2015-01-01 01:31:03+00:00\n    2015-01-01 01:31:27+00:00\n    iap\n    offer2\n    8.99\n    16.3\n    2015-01-01\n    google\n    Germany\n  \n  \n    2\n    ECPANOIXLZHF896\n    ECPANOIXLZHF896-eol2j8bs\n    2015-01-01 01:31:03+00:00\n    2015-01-01 01:36:57+00:00\n    iap\n    gems3\n    22.49\n    16.3\n    2015-01-01\n    google\n    Germany\n  \n  \n    3\n    ECPANOIXLZHF896\n    ECPANOIXLZHF896-eol2j8bs\n    2015-01-01 01:31:03+00:00\n    2015-01-01 01:37:45+00:00\n    iap\n    gold7\n    107.99\n    16.3\n    2015-01-01\n    google\n    Germany\n  \n  \n    4\n    ECPANOIXLZHF896\n    ECPANOIXLZHF896-eol2j8bs\n    2015-01-01 01:31:03+00:00\n    2015-01-01 01:42:33+00:00\n    ad\n    ad_20sec\n    0.76\n    16.3\n    2015-01-01\n    google\n    Germany\n  \n  \n    5\n    ECPANOIXLZHF896\n    ECPANOIXLZHF896-hdu9jkls\n    2015-01-01 11:50:02+00:00\n    2015-01-01 11:55:20+00:00\n    ad\n    ad_5sec\n    0.03\n    35.2\n    2015-01-01\n    google\n    Germany\n  \n  \n    1996\n    NAOJRDMCSEBI281\n    NAOJRDMCSEBI281-j2vs9ilp\n    2015-01-21 01:57:50+00:00\n    2015-01-21 02:02:50+00:00\n    ad\n    ad_survey\n    1.332\n    25.8\n    2015-01-11\n    organic\n    Norway\n  \n  \n    1997\n    NAOJRDMCSEBI281\n    NAOJRDMCSEBI281-j2vs9ilp\n    2015-01-21 01:57:50+00:00\n    2015-01-21 02:22:14+00:00\n    ad\n    ad_survey\n    1.35\n    25.8\n    2015-01-11\n    organic\n    Norway\n  \n  \n    1998\n    RMOSWHJGELCI675\n    RMOSWHJGELCI675-vbhcsmtr\n    2015-01-21 02:39:48+00:00\n    2015-01-21 02:40:00+00:00\n    ad\n    ad_5sec\n    0.03\n    8.4\n    2015-01-10\n    other_campaign\n    France\n  \n  \n    1999\n    RMOSWHJGELCI675\n    RMOSWHJGELCI675-vbhcsmtr\n    2015-01-21 02:39:48+00:00\n    2015-01-21 02:47:12+00:00\n    iap\n    offer5\n    26.09\n    8.4\n    2015-01-10\n    other_campaign\n    France\n  \n  \n    2000\n    GJCXNTWEBIPQ369\n    GJCXNTWEBIPQ369-9elq67md\n    2015-01-21 03:59:23+00:00\n    2015-01-21 04:06:29+00:00\n    ad\n    ad_5sec\n    0.12\n    18.5\n    2015-01-14\n    organic\n    United States\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n        \n\n\nNotice that the table displays only 10 rows by default, 5 from the top and 5 from the bottom. The grey text on the left of the table indicates the row number, and a blue line helps demarcate the top and bottom rows.\nThe preview() function had a few design goals in mind:\n\nget the dimensions of the table and display them prominently in the header\nprovide the column names and the column types\nhave a consistent line height along with a sensible limit to the column width\nuse a monospaced typeface having high legibility\nshould work for all sorts of tables!\n\nThis is a nice drop-in replacement for looking at DataFrames or Ibis tables (the types of tables that Pointblank can work with). If you were to inspect the DuckDB table materialized by pb.load_dataset(dataset=\"game_revenue\", tbl_type=\"duckdb\") without preview() you’d get this:\n\n\nShow the code\npb.load_dataset(dataset=\"game_revenue\", tbl_type=\"duckdb\")\n\n\nDatabaseTable: game_revenue\n  player_id        string\n  session_id       string\n  session_start    timestamp('UTC', 6)\n  time             timestamp('UTC', 6)\n  item_type        string\n  item_name        string\n  item_revenue     float64\n  session_duration float64\n  start_day        date\n  acquisition      string\n  country          string\n\n\n\nWhich is not nearly as good.\n\n\nIn closing\nWe hope this post is a good introduction to Pointblank and that it provides some insight on how Great Tables makes sense for reporting in a different library. If you’d like to learn more about Pointblank, please visit the project website and check out the many examples."

This will signal to Great Tables that the named column should be used as the stub, using the contents of that column to make row labels. Let’s add a stub with our islands dataset by using rowname_col= in the call to GT:\n\nfrom great_tables import GT, md, html\nfrom great_tables.data import islands\n\nislands_mini = islands.head(10)\n\nGT(islands_mini).tab_stub(rowname_col=\"name\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  size\n\n\n\n  \n    Africa\n    11506\n  \n  \n    Antarctica\n    5500\n  \n  \n    Asia\n    16988\n  \n  \n    Australia\n    2968\n  \n  \n    Axel Heiberg\n    16\n  \n  \n    Baffin\n    184\n  \n  \n    Banks\n    23\n  \n  \n    Borneo\n    280\n  \n  \n    Britain\n    84\n  \n  \n    Celebes\n    73\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n        \n\n\nNotice that the landmass names are now placed to the left? That’s the Stub. Notably, there is a prominent border to the right of it but there’s no label above the Stub. We can change this and apply what’s known as a stubhead label through use of the tab_stubhead() method:\n\n(\n    GT(islands_mini)\n    .tab_stub(rowname_col=\"name\")\n    .tab_stubhead(label=\"landmass\")\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  landmass\n  size\n\n\n\n  \n    Africa\n    11506\n  \n  \n    Antarctica\n    5500\n  \n  \n    Asia\n    16988\n  \n  \n    Australia\n    2968\n  \n  \n    Axel Heiberg\n    16\n  \n  \n    Baffin\n    184\n  \n  \n    Banks\n    23\n  \n  \n    Borneo\n    280\n  \n  \n    Britain\n    84\n  \n  \n    Celebes\n    73\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n        \n\n\nA very important thing to note here is that the table now has one column.

The input values, strings of space-separated values, can be considered here as y values and they are evenly spaced along the imaginary x axis.\nHovering over (or touching) the values is something of a treat! You might notice that:\n\ndata values are automatically formatted for you in a compact fashion\nthe plot elements also display pertinent values\n\nThis sort of interactively is baked into the rendered SVG graphics that fmt_nanoplot() generates from your data and selection of options.\nPolars lets us express ‘lists-of-values-per-cell’ in different ways and Great Tables is pretty good at understanding different column dtypes. So, you can alternatively create the same table as above with the following code.\nrandom_numbers_df = pl.DataFrame(\n    {\n        \"example\": [\"Row \" + str(x) for x in range(1, 5)],\n        \"numbers\": [\n            { \"val\": [20, 23, 6, 7, 37, 23, 21, 4, 7, 16] },\n            { \"val\": [2.3, 6.8, 9.2, 2.42, 3.5, 12.1, 5.3, 3.6, 7.2, 3.74] },\n            { \"val\": [-12, -5, 6, 3.7, 0, 8, -7.4] },\n            { \"val\": [2, 0, 15, 7, 8, 10, 1, 24, 17, 13, 6] },\n        ],\n    }\n)\n\nGT(random_numbers_df).fmt_nanoplot(columns=\"numbers\")\nBoth forms of the numbers column in the two DataFrames look the same to fmt_nanoplot(). The key for the list of values (here, \"val\") can be anything as long as it’s repeated down the column. So the choice is yours on how you want to prepare those column values.",

Let’s say you have a very specific use case for your great table, so it’s not necessarily broad enough to contribute to the package. Or maybe it is generalizable, but implementing it is beyond the scope of your current project. Not every feature fits neatly into a pull request.\ngt-extras is a great case study in this, filling your table desires that aren’t supported by Great Tables directly.",

    "title": "Extending Great Tables",
    "section": "Writing an Add-on Function",
    "text": "Writing an Add-on Function\nWhen adding to Great Tables, you have three main approaches: wrapping, extending, and what we might call composing.\n\nWrapping is when you simplify existing functionality by bundling common parameter combinations. It doesn’t add new capabilities, instead makes specific or complex styling tasks more accessible.\nComposing multiple methods into a single function, allowing you to build more complex table logic or reusable patterns.\nExtending, on the other hand, adds new functionality by adding behavior beyond built-in methods. This could include processing data outside the package, or generating custom content (like HTML or images), that gets integrated into your table.\n\nAll approaches are valuable contributions to the Great Tables ecosystem, and the choice between them depends on whether you’re making it easier to access existing tooling or creating entirely new capabilities.\n\nWrapping\nLet’s wrap tab_style() to perform a specific action supported by the general function. tab_style() takes locations= and style= parameters, so let’s assign those. Something this lightweight might be useful for someone who knows what effect they want, but doesn’t want to investigate the entire space of options for styling.\n\ndef highlight_cols(gt: GT, columns: SelectExpr) -&gt; GT:\n    locations = [\n        loc.body(columns=columns),\n        loc.column_labels(columns=columns),\n    ]\n\n    # Make the wrapped tab_style call\n    return gt.tab_style(\n        style=style.fill(color=\"lightblue\"),\n        locations=locations,\n    )\n\nIn fact, many of the functions in gt-extras are wrappers. What you see above is pulled from the source code for the function gt_highlight_cols(), which is a wrapper function that doesn’t add new functionality to Great Tables, instead it makes a common action much easier.\n\n\nComposing\nA little more complex than wrapping, we can also compose methods to perform several steps, such as applying multiple styles, formatting, or themes all at once.\nHere’s a flavor of the composed methods that gt-extras used in the ESPN theme:\n\ndef some_theme(gt: GT) -&gt; GT:\n    return (\n        gt.opt_all_caps()\n        .opt_table_font(\n            font=google_font(\"Lato\"),\n            weight=400,\n        )\n        .opt_row_striping()\n    )\n\nThis is where composing really shines. Maybe you want a very standardized look, or you want all of your tables to mimic your favorite one. Take advantage of tab_options() for your own premade themes, with styles from any of the table theme options of your choosing.\n\n\nExtending\nPerhaps the most complex, this involves new behavior not supported by Great Tables methods alone. Formatting values is a common way to do this:\n\ndef fmt_threshold(gt, columns, threshold: float):\n    \"\"\"Format values to 0 if they are under threshold.\"\"\"\"\n    def _truncate(val: float)\n        return \"0\" if val &lt; threshold else str(val)\n\n    return gt.fmt(_truncate, columns)\n\nAlternatively, we can extend the post-processing step by building an HTML string containing two side-by-side tables. This function takes two separate GT objects, renders them as HTML using as_raw_html(), and then joins them in custom HTML structure, which would not be possible with Great Tables methods alone.\n\ndef double_table(gt1: GT, gt2: GT) -&gt; str:\n    table_1_html = gt1.as_raw_html()\n    table_2_html = gt2.as_raw_html()\n\n    return f\"\"\"&lt;div&gt;{table_1_html}&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;{table_2_html}&lt;/div&gt;\"\"\"\n\nAgain, this is a sneak peek of the gt-extras function, gt_two_column_layout(), which does a little more heavy lifting than Great Tables itself supports. This time, we’re adding new behavior.",

But there are endless plot types you could want in your great tables, and for these fmt() is your friend.\nThe key to adding custom plots to your tables is using fmt() with a function that converts your data values into visual representations. Your formatting function should take a value from your table and return an HTML string containing your plot – whether that’s an SVG, a series of styled &lt;div&gt; elements, or even embedded images.\nHere’s a basic pattern for a plot extension:\n\ndef create_my_plot(value):\n    # Transform the data value into a visual representation\n    # This could use any plotting library or even pure HTML/CSS\n    plot_html = f\"&lt;svg&gt;...&lt;/svg&gt;\"  # Your plot generation logic here\n    return plot_html\n\n\n# Apply to your table\ngt.fmt(fns=create_my_plot, columns=\"my_data_column\")\n\nCheck out this blog post for a deeper dive into different approaches for creating plots in tables.",

Speaking of which, the main entry point into the Great Tables API is the GT class. Let’s use that to make a presentable table:\n\n# Create a display table showing ten of the largest islands in the world\ngt_tbl = GT(islands_mini)\n\n# Show the output table\ngt_tbl\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  name\n  size\n\n\n\n  \n    Africa\n    11506\n  \n  \n    Antarctica\n    5500\n  \n  \n    Asia\n    16988\n  \n  \n    Australia\n    2968\n  \n  \n    Axel Heiberg\n    16\n  \n  \n    Baffin\n    184\n  \n  \n    Banks\n    23\n  \n  \n    Borneo\n    280\n  \n  \n    Britain\n    84\n  \n  \n    Celebes\n    73\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n        \n\n\nThat doesn’t look too bad!

Tables won’t print to the console, but using the show() method on a table object while in the console will open the HTML table in your default browser.",

This method allows for mapping to be defined by column names, existing spanner ID values, or a mixture of both.\nThe spanners are placed in the order of calling tab_spanner() so if a later call uses the same columns in its definition (or even a subset) as the first invocation, the second spanner will be overlaid atop the first.

We can optionally use the md() and html() helper functions to style the text as Markdown or to retain HTML elements in the text. Alternatively, units notation can be used (see define_units() for details).\n\ncolumns : SelectExpr = None\n\nThe columns to target. Can either be a single column name or a series of column names provided in a list.\n\nspanners : str | list[str] | None = None\n\nThe spanners that should be spanned over, should they already be defined. One or more spanner ID values (in quotes) can be supplied here. This argument works in tandem with the columns argument.\n\nlevel : int | None = None\n\nAn explicit level to which the spanner should be placed. If not provided, Great Tables will choose the level based on the inputs provided within columns and spanners, placing the spanner label where it will fit. The first spanner level (right above the column labels) is 0.\n\nid : str | None = None\n\nThe ID for the spanner. When accessing a spanner through the spanners argument of tab_spanner() the id value is used as the reference (and not the label). If an id is not explicitly provided here, it will be taken from the label value. It is advisable to set an explicit id value if you plan to access this cell in a later call and the label text is complicated (e.g., contains markup, is lengthy, or both). Finally, when providing an id value you must ensure that it is unique across all ID values set for spanner labels (the method will throw an error if id isn’t unique).\n\ngather : bool = True\n\nAn option to move the specified columns such that they are unified under the spanner. Ordering of the moved-into-place columns will be preserved in all cases. By default, this is set to True.\n\nreplace : bool = False\n\nShould new spanners be allowed to partially or fully replace existing spanners? (This is a possibility if setting spanners at an already populated level.) By default, this is set to False and an error will occur if some replacement is attempted."

What if you want granular control to specify a spanner in a specific hierarchy? Great Tables has you covered. By using the level= parameter, you can easily adjust the hierarchy of spanners. For example, by specifying level=0 for the last call of tab_spanner(), you can place that spanner at the bottom level (level 0) instead of the top level (level 2).\n\n(\n    GT(gtcars_mini)\n    .tab_spanner(\n        label=\"hp\",\n        columns=[\"hp\", \"hp_rpm\"],\n    )\n    .tab_spanner(\n        label=\"performance\",\n        columns=[\"hp\", \"hp_rpm\", \"trq\", \"trq_rpm\"],\n    )\n    .tab_spanner(\n        label=\"trq\",\n        columns=[\"trq\", \"trq_rpm\"],\n        level=0,\n    )\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n     \n  \n  \n    performance\n  \n  \n     \n  \n\n\n  model\n  \n    hp\n  \n  \n    trq\n  \n  mpg_c\n  mpg_h\n\n\n  hp\n  hp_rpm\n  trq\n  trq_rpm\n\n\n\n  \n    GT\n    647.0\n    6250.0\n    550.0\n    5900.0\n    11.0\n    18.0\n  \n  \n    458 Speciale\n    597.0\n    9000.0\n    398.0\n    6000.0\n    13.0\n    17.0\n  \n  \n    458 Spider\n    562.0\n    9000.0\n    398.0\n    6000.0\n    13.0\n    17.0\n  \n  \n    458 Italia\n    562.0\n    9000.0\n    398.0\n    6000.0\n    13.0\n    17.0\n  \n  \n    488 GTB\n    661.0\n    8000.0\n    561.0\n    3000.0\n    15.0\n    22.0\n  \n  \n    California\n    553.0\n    7500.0\n    557.0\n    4750.0\n    16.0\n    23.0\n  \n  \n    GTC4Lusso\n    680.0\n    8250.0\n    514.0\n    5750.0\n    12.0\n    17.0\n  \n  \n    FF\n    652.0\n    8000.0\n    504.0\n    6000.0\n    11.0\n    16.0\n  \n  \n    F12Berlinetta\n    731.0\n    8250.0\n    509.0\n    6000.0\n    11.0\n    16.0\n  \n  \n    LaFerrari\n    949.0\n    9000.0\n    664.0\n    6750.0\n    12.0\n    16.0\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n        \n\n\nWe can also use Markdown formatting for the spanner label.

    "text": "data.photolysis\nData on photolysis rates for gas-phase organic compounds.\nThe photolysis dataset contains numerical values for describing the photolytic degradation pathways of 25 compounds of relevance in atmospheric chemistry. Many volatile organic compounds (VOCs) are emitted in substantial quantities from both biogenic and anthropogenic sources, and they can have a major influence on the chemistry of the lower atmosphere. A portion of these can be transformed into other VOCs via the energy provided from light.\nIn order to realistically predict the composition of the atmosphere and how it evolves over time, we need accurate estimates of photolysis rates. The data provided here in photolysis allows for computations of photolysis rates (J, having units of s^-1) as a function of the solar zenith angle (SZA). Having such values is essential when deploying atmospheric chemistry models.\n\n\nThis is a dataset with 34 rows and 10 columns.\n\ncompd_name: The name of the primary compound undergoing photolysis.\ncmpd_formula: The chemical formula of the compound.\nproducts: A product pathway for the photolysis of the compound.\ntype: The type of organic compound undergoing photolysis.\nl, m, n: The parameter values given in the l, m, and n columnscan be used to calculate the photolysis rate (J) as a function of the solar zenith angle (X, in radians) through the expression: J = l * cos(X)^m * exp(-n * sec(X)).\nquantum_yield: In the context of photolysis reactions, this is the efficiency of a given photolytic reaction.

Can either be a single column name or a series of column names provided in a list.\n\nrows : int | list[int] | None = None\n\nIn conjunction with columns=, we can specify which of their rows should undergo formatting. The default is all rows, resulting in all rows in targeted columns being formatted. Alternatively, we can supply a list of row indices.\n\ndecimals : int = 2\n\nThe decimals values corresponds to the exact number of decimal places to use. A value such as 2.34 can, for example, be formatted with 0 decimal places and it would result in \"2\". With 4 decimal places, the formatted value becomes \"2.3400\". The trailing zeros can be removed with drop_trailing_zeros=True.\n\ndrop_trailing_zeros : bool = False\n\nA boolean value that allows for removal of trailing zeros (those redundant zeros after the decimal mark).\n\ndrop_trailing_dec_mark : bool = True\n\nA boolean value that determines whether decimal marks should always appear even if there are no decimal digits to display after formatting (e.g., 23 becomes 23. if False). By default trailing decimal marks are not shown.\n\nscale_values : bool = True\n\nShould the values be scaled through multiplication by 100? By default this scaling is performed since the expectation is that incoming values are usually proportional. Setting to False signifies that the values are already scaled and require only the percent sign when formatted.\n\nuse_seps : bool = True\n\nThe use_seps option allows for the use of digit group separators. The type of digit group separator is set by sep_mark and overridden if a locale ID is provided to locale. This setting is True by default.\n\naccounting : bool = False\n\nWhether to use accounting style, which wraps negative numbers in parentheses instead of using a minus sign.\n\npattern : str = '{x}'\n\nA formatting pattern that allows for decoration of the formatted value. The formatted value is represented by the {x} (which can be used multiple times, if needed) and all other characters will be interpreted as string literals.\n\nsep_mark : str = ','\n\nThe string to use as a separator between groups of digits. For example, using sep_mark=\",\" with a value of 1000 would result in a formatted value of \"1,000\". This argument is ignored if a locale is supplied (i.e., is not None).\n\ndec_mark : str = '.'\n\nThe string to be used as the decimal mark. For example, using dec_mark=\",\" with the value 0.152 would result in a formatted value of \"0,152\"). This argument is ignored if a locale is supplied (i.e., is not None).\n\nforce_sign : bool = False\n\nShould the positive sign be shown for positive values (effectively showing a sign for all values except zero)? If so, use True for this option. The default is False, where only negative numbers will display a minus sign.\n\nplacement : str = 'right'\n\nThis option governs the placement of the percent sign. This can be either be \"right\" (the default) or \"left\".\n\nincl_space : bool = False\n\nAn option for whether to include a space between the value and the percent sign. The default is to not introduce a space character.\n\nlocale : str | None = None\n\nAn optional locale identifier that can be used for formatting values according the locale’s rules. Examples include \"en\" for English (United States) and \"fr\" for French (France)."

There are six styles to choose from and they largely vary in the extent of coloring applied to different table locations. Some have table borders applied, some apply darker colors to the table stub and summary sections, and, some even have vertical lines. In addition to choosing a style preset, there are six color variations that each use a range of five color tints. Each of the color tints have been fine-tuned to maximize the contrast between text and its background. There are 36 combinations of style and color to choose from.

    "text": "The font stacks and the individual fonts used by platform\n\nSystem UI (\"system-ui\")\nfont-family: system-ui, sans-serif;\nThe operating system interface’s default typefaces are known as system UI fonts. They contain a variety of font weights, are quite readable at small sizes, and are perfect for UI elements. These typefaces serve as a great starting point for text in data tables and so this font stack is the default for Great Tables.\n\n\nTransitional (\"transitional\")\nfont-family: Charter, 'Bitstream Charter', 'Sitka Text', Cambria, serif;\nThe Enlightenment saw the development of transitional typefaces, which combine Old Style and Modern typefaces. Times New Roman, a transitional typeface created for the Times of London newspaper, is among the most well-known instances of this style.\n\n\nOld Style (\"old-style\")\nfont-family: 'Iowan Old Style', 'Palatino Linotype', 'URW Palladio L', P052, serif;\nOld style typefaces were created during the Renaissance and are distinguished by diagonal stress, a lack of contrast between thick and thin strokes, and rounded serifs. Garamond is among the most well-known instances of an antique typeface.\n\n\nHumanist (\"humanist\")\nfont-family: Seravek, 'Gill Sans Nova', Ubuntu, Calibri, 'DejaVu Sans', source-sans-pro, sans-serif;\nLow contrast between thick and thin strokes and organic, calligraphic forms are traits of humanist typefaces. These typefaces, which draw their inspiration from Renaissance calligraphy, are frequently regarded as being more readable and easier to read than other sans serif typefaces.\n\n\nGeometric Humanist (\"geometric-humanist\")\nfont-family: Avenir, Montserrat, Corbel, 'URW Gothic', source-sans-pro, sans-serif;\nClean, geometric forms and consistent stroke widths are characteristics of geometric humanist typefaces. These typefaces, which are frequently used for headlines and other display purposes, are frequently thought to be contemporary and slick in appearance. A well-known example of this classification is Futura.\n\n\nClassical Humanist (\"classical-humanist\")\nfont-family: Optima, Candara, 'Noto Sans', source-sans-pro, sans-serif;\nThe way the strokes gradually widen as they approach the stroke terminals without ending in a serif is what distinguishes classical humanist typefaces. The stone carving on Renaissance-era tombstones and classical Roman capitals served as inspiration for these typefaces.\n\n\nNeo-Grotesque (\"neo-grotesque\")\nfont-family: Inter, Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', 'Arial Nova', 'Nimbus Sans', Arial, sans-serif;\nNeo-grotesque typefaces are a form of sans serif that originated in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. They are distinguished by their crisp, geometric shapes and regular stroke widths. Helvetica is among the most well-known examples of a Neo-grotesque typeface.\n\n\nMonospace Slab Serif (\"monospace-slab-serif\")\nfont-family: 'Nimbus Mono PS', 'Courier New', monospace;\nMonospace slab serif typefaces are distinguished by their fixed-width letters, which are the same width irrespective of their shape, and their straightforward, geometric forms. For reports, tabular work, and technical documentation, this technique is used to simulate typewriter output.\n\n\nMonospace Code (\"monospace-code\")\nfont-family: ui-monospace, 'Cascadia Code', 'Source Code Pro', Menlo, Consolas, 'DejaVu Sans Mono', monospace;\nSpecifically created for use in programming and other technical applications, monospace code typefaces are used in these fields. These typefaces are distinguished by their clear, readable forms and monospaced design, which ensures that all letters and characters are the same width.\n\n\nIndustrial (\"industrial\")\nfont-family: Bahnschrift, 'DIN Alternate', 'Franklin Gothic Medium', 'Nimbus Sans Narrow', sans-serif-condensed, sans-serif;\nThe development of industrial typefaces began in the late 19th century and was greatly influenced by the industrial and technological advancements of the time. Industrial typefaces are distinguished by their strong sans serif letterforms, straightforward appearance, and use of geometric shapes and straight lines.\n\n\nRounded Sans (\"rounded-sans\")\nfont-family: ui-rounded, 'Hiragino Maru Gothic ProN', Quicksand, Comfortaa, Manjari, 'Arial Rounded MT', 'Arial Rounded MT Bold', Calibri, source-sans-pro, sans-serif;\nThe rounded, curved letterforms that define rounded typefaces give them a softer, friendlier appearance. The typeface’s rounded edges give it a more natural and playful feel, making it appropriate for use in casual or kid-friendly designs. Since the 1950s, the rounded sans-serif design has gained popularity and is still frequently used in branding, graphic design, and other fields.\n\n\nSlab Serif (\"slab-serif\")\nfont-family: Rockwell, 'Rockwell Nova', 'Roboto Slab', 'DejaVu Serif', 'Sitka Small', serif;\nSlab Serif typefaces are distinguished by the thick, block-like serifs that appear at the ends of each letterform. Typically, these serifs are unbracketed, which means that they do not have any curved or tapered transitions to the letter’s main stroke.\n\n\nAntique (\"antique\")\nfont-family: Superclarendon, 'Bookman Old Style', 'URW Bookman', 'URW Bookman L', 'Georgia Pro', Georgia, serif;\nSerif typefaces that were popular in the 19th century include antique typefaces, also referred to as Egyptians. They are distinguished by their thick, uniform stroke weight and block-like serifs. The typeface Clarendon is a highly regarded example of this style and Superclarendon is a modern take on that revered typeface.\n\n\nDidone (\"didone\")\nfont-family: Didot, 'Bodoni MT', 'Noto Serif Display', 'URW Palladio L', P052, Sylfaen, serif;\nDidone typefaces, also referred to as Modern typefaces, are distinguished by their vertical stress, sharp contrast between thick and thin strokes, and hairline serifs without bracketing. The Didone style first appeared in the late 18th century and became well-known in the early 19th century. Bodoni and Didot are two of the most well-known typefaces in this category.\n\n\nHandwritten (\"handwritten\")\nfont-family: 'Segoe Print', 'Bradley Hand', Chilanka, TSCu_Comic, casual, cursive;\nThe appearance and feel of handwriting are replicated by handwritten typefaces. Although there are a wide variety of handwriting styles, this font stack tends to use a more casual and commonplace style. In regards to these types of fonts in tables, one can say that any table having a handwritten font will evoke a feeling of gleefulness."

    "text": "Parameters\n\ncolumns : SelectExpr = None\n\nThe columns to target. Can either be a single column name or a series of column names provided in a list.\n\nrows : int | list[int] | None = None\n\nIn conjunction with columns=, we can specify which of their rows should undergo formatting. The default is all rows, resulting in all rows in targeted columns being formatted. Alternatively, we can supply a list of row indices.\n\ndecimals : int = 2\n\nThe decimals values corresponds to the exact number of decimal places to use. A value such as 2.34 can, for example, be formatted with 0 decimal places and it would result in \"2\". With 4 decimal places, the formatted value becomes \"2.3400\". The trailing zeros can be removed with drop_trailing_zeros=True. If you always need decimals = 0, the fmt_integer() method should be considered.\n\nn_sigfig : int | None = None\n\nA option to format numbers to n significant figures. By default, this is None and thus number values will be formatted according to the number of decimal places set via decimals. If opting to format according to the rules of significant figures, n_sigfig must be a number greater than or equal to 1. Any values passed to the decimals and drop_trailing_zeros arguments will be ignored.\n\ndrop_trailing_zeros : bool = False\n\nA boolean value that allows for removal of trailing zeros (those redundant zeros after the decimal mark).\n\ndrop_trailing_dec_mark : bool = True\n\nA boolean value that determines whether decimal marks should always appear even if there are no decimal digits to display after formatting (e.g., 23 becomes 23. if False). By default trailing decimal marks are not shown.\n\nuse_seps : bool = True\n\nThe use_seps option allows for the use of digit group separators. The type of digit group separator is set by sep_mark and overridden if a locale ID is provided to locale. This setting is True by default.\n\naccounting : bool = False\n\nWhether to use accounting style, which wraps negative numbers in parentheses instead of using a minus sign.\n\nscale_by : float = 1\n\nAll numeric values will be multiplied by the scale_by value before undergoing formatting. Since the default value is 1, no values will be changed unless a different multiplier value is supplied.\n\ncompact : bool = False\n\nA boolean value that allows for compact formatting of numeric values. Values will be scaled and decorated with the appropriate suffixes (e.g., 1230 becomes 1.23K, and 1230000 becomes 1.23M). The compact option is False by default.\n\npattern : str = '{x}'\n\nA formatting pattern that allows for decoration of the formatted value. The formatted value is represented by the {x} (which can be used multiple times, if needed) and all other characters will be interpreted as string literals.\n\nsep_mark : str = ','\n\nThe string to use as a separator between groups of digits. For example, using sep_mark=\",\" with a value of 1000 would result in a formatted value of \"1,000\". This argument is ignored if a locale is supplied (i.e., is not None).\n\ndec_mark : str = '.'\n\nThe string to be used as the decimal mark. For example, using dec_mark=\",\" with the value 0.152 would result in a formatted value of \"0,152\"). This argument is ignored if a locale is supplied (i.e., is not None).\n\nforce_sign : bool = False\n\nShould the positive sign be shown for positive values (effectively showing a sign for all values except zero)? If so, use True for this option. The default is False, where only negative numbers will display a minus sign.\n\nlocale : str | None = None\n\nAn optional locale identifier that can be used for formatting values according the locale’s rules. Examples include \"en\" for English (United States) and \"fr\" for French (France)."

The former contains unique values that are ideal for labeling rows, and this often happens in what is called the ‘stub’ (a reserved area that serves to label rows). With the GT() class, we can immediately place the contents of the row column into the stub column. To do this, we use the rowname_col= argument with the appropriate column name.\n\nfrom great_tables import GT, exibble\n\nGT(exibble, rowname_col=\"row\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  num\n  char\n  fctr\n  date\n  time\n  datetime\n  currency\n  group\n\n\n\n  \n    row_1\n    0.1111\n    apricot\n    one\n    2015-01-15\n    13:35\n    2018-01-01 02:22\n    49.95\n    grp_a\n  \n  \n    row_2\n    2.222\n    banana\n    two\n    2015-02-15\n    14:40\n    2018-02-02 14:33\n    17.95\n    grp_a\n  \n  \n    row_3\n    33.33\n    coconut\n    three\n    2015-03-15\n    15:45\n    2018-03-03 03:44\n    1.39\n    grp_a\n  \n  \n    row_4\n    444.4\n    durian\n    four\n    2015-04-15\n    16:50\n    2018-04-04 15:55\n    65100.0\n    grp_a\n  \n  \n    row_5\n    5550.0\n    \n    five\n    2015-05-15\n    17:55\n    2018-05-05 04:00\n    1325.81\n    grp_b\n  \n  \n    row_6\n    \n    fig\n    six\n    2015-06-15\n    \n    2018-06-06 16:11\n    13.255\n    grp_b\n  \n  \n    row_7\n    777000.0\n    grapefruit\n    seven\n    \n    19:10\n    2018-07-07 05:22\n    \n    grp_b\n  \n  \n    row_8\n    8880000.0\n    honeydew\n    eight\n    2015-08-15\n    20:20\n    \n    0.44\n    grp_b\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n        \n\n\nThis sets up a table with a stub, the row labels are placed within the stub column, and a vertical dividing line has been placed on the right-hand side.\nThe group column contains categorical values that are ideal for grouping rows.

The alignment is governed by the types of values in a column. If you’d like to disable this form of auto-alignment, the auto_align=False option can be taken.\n\nfrom great_tables import GT, exibble\n\nGT(exibble, rowname_col=\"row\", auto_align=False)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  num\n  char\n  fctr\n  date\n  time\n  datetime\n  currency\n  group\n\n\n\n  \n    row_1\n    0.1111\n    apricot\n    one\n    2015-01-15\n    13:35\n    2018-01-01 02:22\n    49.95\n    grp_a\n  \n  \n    row_2\n    2.222\n    banana\n    two\n    2015-02-15\n    14:40\n    2018-02-02 14:33\n    17.95\n    grp_a\n  \n  \n    row_3\n    33.33\n    coconut\n    three\n    2015-03-15\n    15:45\n    2018-03-03 03:44\n    1.39\n    grp_a\n  \n  \n    row_4\n    444.4\n    durian\n    four\n    2015-04-15\n    16:50\n    2018-04-04 15:55\n    65100.0\n    grp_a\n  \n  \n    row_5\n    5550.0\n    \n    five\n    2015-05-15\n    17:55\n    2018-05-05 04:00\n    1325.81\n    grp_b\n  \n  \n    row_6\n    \n    fig\n    six\n    2015-06-15\n    \n    2018-06-06 16:11\n    13.255\n    grp_b\n  \n  \n    row_7\n    777000.0\n    grapefruit\n    seven\n    \n    19:10\n    2018-07-07 05:22\n    \n    grp_b\n  \n  \n    row_8\n    8880000.0\n    honeydew\n    eight\n    2015-08-15\n    20:20\n    \n    0.44\n    grp_b\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n        \n\n\nWhat you’ll get from that is center-alignment of all table body values and all column labels. Note that row labels in the the stub are still left-aligned; and auto_align= has no effect on alignment within the table stub.\nHowever which way you generate the initial table object, you can modify it with a huge variety of methods to further customize the presentation. Formatting body cells is commonly done with the family of formatting methods (e.g., fmt_number(), fmt_date(), etc.). The package supports formatting with internationalization (‘i18n’ features) and so locale-aware methods all come with a locale= argument. To avoid having to use that argument repeatedly, the GT() class has its own locale= argument. Setting a locale in that will make it available globally. Here’s an example of how that works in practice when setting locale = \"fr\" in GT() prior to using formatting methods:\n\nfrom great_tables import GT, exibble\n\n(\n    GT(exibble, rowname_col=\"row\", locale=\"fr\")\n    .fmt_currency(columns=\"currency\")\n    .fmt_scientific(columns=\"num\")\n    .fmt_date(columns=\"date\", date_style=\"day_month_year\")\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  num\n  char\n  fctr\n  date\n  time\n  datetime\n  currency\n  group\n\n\n\n  \n    row_1\n    1,11 × 10−1\n    apricot\n    one\n    15 janvier 2015\n    13:35\n    2018-01-01 02:22\n    €49,95\n    grp_a\n  \n  \n    row_2\n    2,22\n    banana\n    two\n    15 février 2015\n    14:40\n    2018-02-02 14:33\n    €17,95\n    grp_a\n  \n  \n    row_3\n    3,33 × 101\n    coconut\n    three\n    15 mars 2015\n    15:45\n    2018-03-03 03:44\n    €1,39\n    grp_a\n  \n  \n    row_4\n    4,44 × 102\n    durian\n    four\n    15 avril 2015\n    16:50\n    2018-04-04 15:55\n    €65 100,00\n    grp_a\n  \n  \n    row_5\n    5,55 × 103\n    \n    five\n    15 mai 2015\n    17:55\n    2018-05-05 04:00\n    €1 325,81\n    grp_b\n  \n  \n    row_6\n    \n    fig\n    six\n    15 juin 2015\n    \n    2018-06-06 16:11\n    €13,26\n    grp_b\n  \n  \n    row_7\n    7,77 × 105\n    grapefruit\n    seven\n    \n    19:10\n    2018-07-07 05:22\n    \n    grp_b\n  \n  \n    row_8\n    8,88 × 106\n    honeydew\n    eight\n    15 août 2015\n    20:20\n    \n    €0,44\n    grp_b\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n        \n\n\nIn this example, the fmt_currency(), fmt_scientific(), and fmt_date() methods understand that the locale for this table is \"fr\" (French), so the appropriate formatting for that locale is apparent in the currency, num, and date columns."

The reaction-rate values and parameters within this dataset are useful for studies of the atmospheric environment. Organic pollutants, which are present in trace amounts in the atmosphere, have been extensively studied by research groups since their persistence in the atmosphere requires specific attention. Many researchers have reported kinetic data on specific gas-phase reactions and these mainly involve oxidation reactions with OH, nitrate radicals, ozone, and chlorine atoms.\nThis compilation of rate constant (k) data as contains the values for rate constants at 298 K (in units of cm^3 molecules^-1 s^-1) as well as parameters that allow for the calculation of rate constants at different temperatures (the temperature dependence parameters: A, B, and n). Uncertainty values/factors and temperature limits are also provided here where information is available.\n\n\nThis is a dataset with 1,683 rows and 39 columns.\n\ncompd_name: The name of the primary compound undergoing reaction with OH, nitrate radicals, ozone, or chlorine atoms.\ncmpd_mwt: The molecular weight of the compound in units of g/mol.\ncmpd_formula: The chemical formula of the compound.\ncmpd_type: The category of compounds that the compd_name falls under.\ncmpd_smiles: The SMILES (simplified molecular-input line-entry system) representation for the compound.\ncmpd_inchi: The InChI (International Chemical Identifier) representation for the compound.\ncmpd_inchikey: The InChIKey, which is a hashed InChI value, has a fixed length of 27 characters. These values can be used to more easily perform database searches of chemical compounds.\nOH_k298: Rate constant at 298 K for OH reactions.\nOH_uncert: Uncertainty as a percentage for certain OH reactions.\nOH_u_fac: Uncertainty as a plus/minus difference for certain OH reactions.\nOH_a, OH_b, OH_n: Extended temperature dependence parameters for bimolecular OH reactions, to be used in the Arrhenius expression: k(T)=A exp(-B/T) (T/300)^n.

The table comprises laboratory findings for the patient from day 3 of illness onset until day 9 (after which the patient died). YF viral DNA was found in serum samples from day 3, where the viral load reached 14,000 copies per mL. Several medical interventions were taken to help the patient, including the administration of fresh frozen plasma, platelets, red cells, and coagulation factor VIII. The patient also received advanced support treatment in the form of mechanical ventilation and plasmapheresis.

When combined the construction is either of the form m x 10^n or mEn. The mantissa is a number between 1 and 1000 and the exponent is a multiple of 3. For example, the number 0.0000345 can be written in engineering notation as 34.50 x 10^-6. This notation helps to simplify calculations and make it easier to compare numbers that are on very different scales.\nEngineering notation is particularly useful as it aligns with SI prefixes (e.g., milli-, micro-, kilo-, mega-). For instance, numbers in engineering notation with exponent -3 correspond to milli-units, while those with exponent 6 correspond to mega-units.\nWe have fine control over the formatting task, with the following options:"

    "text": "Parameters\n\ncolumns : SelectExpr = None\n\nThe columns to target. Can either be a single column name or a series of column names provided in a list.\n\nrows : int | list[int] | None = None\n\nIn conjunction with columns=, we can specify which of their rows should undergo formatting. The default is all rows, resulting in all rows in targeted columns being formatted. Alternatively, we can supply a list of row indices.\n\ndecimals : int = 2\n\nThe decimals values corresponds to the exact number of decimal places to use. A value such as 2.34 can, for example, be formatted with 0 decimal places and it would result in \"2\". With 4 decimal places, the formatted value becomes \"2.3400\". The trailing zeros can be removed with drop_trailing_zeros=True.\n\nn_sigfig : int | None = None\n\nA option to format numbers to n significant figures. By default, this is None and thus number values will be formatted according to the number of decimal places set via decimals. If opting to format according to the rules of significant figures, n_sigfig must be a number greater than or equal to 1. Any values passed to the decimals and drop_trailing_zeros arguments will be ignored.\n\ndrop_trailing_zeros : bool = False\n\nA boolean value that allows for removal of trailing zeros (those redundant zeros after the decimal mark).\n\ndrop_trailing_dec_mark : bool = True\n\nA boolean value that determines whether decimal marks should always appear even if there are no decimal digits to display after formatting (e.g., 23 becomes 23. if False). By default trailing decimal marks are not shown.\n\nscale_by : float = 1\n\nAll numeric values will be multiplied by the scale_by value before undergoing formatting. Since the default value is 1, no values will be changed unless a different multiplier value is supplied.\n\nexp_style : str = 'x10n'\n\nStyle of formatting to use for the engineering notation formatting. By default this is \"x10n\" but other options include using a single letter (e.g., \"e\", \"E\", etc.), a letter followed by a \"1\" to signal a minimum digit width of one, or \"low-ten\" for using a stylized \"10\" marker.\n\npattern : str = '{x}'\n\nA formatting pattern that allows for decoration of the formatted value. The formatted value is represented by the {x} (which can be used multiple times, if needed) and all other characters will be interpreted as string literals.\n\ndec_mark : str = '.'\n\nThe string to be used as the decimal mark. For example, using dec_mark=\",\" with the value 0.152 would result in a formatted value of \"0,152\"). This argument is ignored if a locale is supplied (i.e., is not None).\n\nforce_sign_m : bool = False\n\nShould the plus sign be shown for positive values of the mantissa (first component)? This would effectively show a sign for all values except zero on the first numeric component of the notation. If so, use True (the default for this is False), where only negative numbers will display a sign.\n\nforce_sign_n : bool = False\n\nShould the plus sign be shown for positive values of the exponent (second component)? This would effectively show a sign for all values except zero on the second numeric component of the notation. If so, use True (the default for this is False), where only negative numbers will display a sign.\n\nlocale : str | None = None\n\nAn optional locale identifier that can be used for formatting values according the locale’s rules. Examples include \"en\" for English (United States) and \"fr\" for French (France)."

By default this is set to 10. Individual radius values can be set by using a list of numeric values; however, the list provided must match the number of data points.\n\ndata_point_stroke_color : str | list[str] | None = None\n\nThe default stroke color of the data points is \"#FFFFFF\" (\"white\"). This works well when there is a visible data line combined with data points with a darker fill color. The stroke color can be modified with data_point_stroke_color= for all data points by supplying a single color value. With a list of colors, each data point’s stroke color can be changed (ensure that the list length matches the number of data points).\n\ndata_point_stroke_width : int | list[int] | None = None\n\nThe width of the outside stroke for the data points can be modified with the data_point_stroke_width= option. By default, a value of 4 (as in ‘4px’) is used.\n\ndata_point_fill_color : str | list[str] | None = None\n\nBy default, all data points have a fill color of \"#FF0000\" (\"red\"). This can be changed for all data points by providing a different color to data_point_fill_color=. And, a list of different colors can be supplied so long as the length is equal to the number of data points; the fill color values will be applied in order of left to right.\n\ndata_line_type : str | None = None\n\nThis can accept either \"curved\" or \"straight\". Curved lines are recommended when the nanoplot has less than 30 points and data points are evenly spaced. In most other cases, straight lines might present better.\n\ndata_line_stroke_color : str | None = None\n\nThe color of the data line can be modified from its default \"#4682B4\" (\"steelblue\") color by supplying a color to the data_line_stroke_color= option.\n\ndata_line_stroke_width : int | None = None\n\nThe width of the connecting data line can be modified with data_line_stroke_width=. By default, a value of 4 (as in ‘4px’) is used.\n\ndata_area_fill_color : str | None = None\n\nThe fill color for the area that bounds the data points in line plot. The default is \"#FF0000\" (\"red\") but can be changed by providing a color value to data_area_fill_color=.\n\ndata_bar_stroke_color : str | list[str] | None = None\n\nThe color of the stroke used for the data bars can be modified from its default \"#3290CC\" color by supplying a color to data_bar_stroke_color=.\n\ndata_bar_stroke_width : int | list[int] | None = None\n\nThe width of the stroke used for the data bars can be modified with the data_bar_stroke_width= option. By default, a value of 4 (as in ‘4px’) is used.\n\ndata_bar_fill_color : str | list[str] | None = None\n\nBy default, all data bars have a fill color of \"#3FB5FF\". This can be changed for all data bars by providing a different color to data_bar_fill_color=. And, a list of different colors can be supplied so long as the length is equal to the number of data bars; the fill color values will be applied in order of left to right.\n\ndata_bar_negative_stroke_color : str | None = None\n\nThe color of the stroke used for the data bars that have negative values. The default color is \"#CC3243\" but this can be changed by supplying a color value to the data_bar_negative_stroke_color= option.\n\ndata_bar_negative_stroke_width : int | None = None\n\nThe width of the stroke used for negative value data bars. This has the same default as data_bar_stroke_width= with a value of 4 (as in ‘4px’). This can be changed by giving a numeric value to the data_bar_negative_stroke_width= option.\n\ndata_bar_negative_fill_color : str | None = None\n\nBy default, all negative data bars have a fill color of \"#D75A68\". This can however be changed by providing a color value to data_bar_negative_fill_color=.\n\nreference_line_color : str | None = None\n\nThe reference line will have a color of \"#75A8B0\" if it is set to appear. This color can be changed by providing a single color value to reference_line_color=.\n\nreference_area_fill_color : str | None = None\n\nIf a reference area has been defined and is visible it has by default a fill color of \"#A6E6F2\". This can be modified by declaring a color value in the reference_area_fill_color= option.\n\nvertical_guide_stroke_color : str | None = None\n\nVertical guides appear when hovering in the vicinity of data points. Their default color is \"#911EB4\" (a strong magenta color) and a fill opacity value of 0.4 is automatically applied to this. However, the base color can be changed with the vertical_guide_stroke_color= option.\n\nvertical_guide_stroke_width : int | None = None\n\nThe vertical guide’s stroke width, by default, is relatively large at 12 (this is ‘12px’). This is modifiable by setting a different value with vertical_guide_stroke_width=.\n\nshow_data_points : bool | None = None\n\nBy default, all data points in a nanoplot are shown but this layer can be hidden by setting show_data_points= to False.\n\nshow_data_line : bool | None = None\n\nThe data line connects data points together and it is shown by default. This data line layer can be hidden by setting show_data_line= to False.\n\nshow_data_area : bool | None = None\n\nThe data area layer is adjacent to the data points and the data line. It is shown by default but can be hidden with show_data_area=False.\n\nshow_reference_line : bool | None = None\n\nThe layer with a horizontal reference line appears underneath that of the data points and the data line. Like vertical guides, hovering over a reference will show its value. The reference line (if available) is shown by default but can be hidden by setting show_reference_line= to False.\n\nshow_reference_area : bool | None = None\n\nThe reference area appears at the very bottom of the layer stack, if it is available (i.e., defined in cols_nanoplot()). It will be shown in the default case but can be hidden by using show_reference_area=False.\n\nshow_vertical_guides : bool | None = None\n\nVertical guides appear when hovering over data points. This hidden layer is active by default but can be deactivated by using show_vertical_guides=False.\n\nshow_y_axis_guide : bool | None = None\n\nThe y-axis guide will appear when hovering over the far left side of a nanoplot. This hidden layer is active by default but can be deactivated by using show_y_axis_guide=False.\n\ninteractive_data_values : bool | None = None\n\nBy default, numeric data values will be shown only when the user interacts with certain regions of a nanoplot. This is because the values may be numerous (i.e., clutter the display when all are visible) and it can be argued that the values themselves are secondary to the presentation. However, for some types of plots (like horizontal bar plots), a persistent display of values alongside the plot marks may be desirable.

    "text": "data_point_radius : int | list[int] | None = None\n\nThe data_point_radius= option lets you set the radius for each of the data points. By default this is set to 10. Individual radius values can be set by using a list of numeric values; however, the list provided must match the number of data points.\n\ndata_point_stroke_color : str | list[str] | None = None\n\nThe default stroke color of the data points is \"#FFFFFF\" (\"white\"). This works well when there is a visible data line combined with data points with a darker fill color. The stroke color can be modified with data_point_stroke_color= for all data points by supplying a single color value. With a list of colors, each data point’s stroke color can be changed (ensure that the list length matches the number of data points).\n\ndata_point_stroke_width : int | list[int] | None = None\n\nThe width of the outside stroke for the data points can be modified with the data_point_stroke_width= option. By default, a value of 4 (as in ‘4px’) is used.\n\ndata_point_fill_color : str | list[str] | None = None\n\nBy default, all data points have a fill color of \"#FF0000\" (\"red\"). This can be changed for all data points by providing a different color to data_point_fill_color=. And, a list of different colors can be supplied so long as the length is equal to the number of data points; the fill color values will be applied in order of left to right.\n\ndata_line_type : str | None = None\n\nThis can accept either \"curved\" or \"straight\". Curved lines are recommended when the nanoplot has less than 30 points and data points are evenly spaced. In most other cases, straight lines might present better.\n\ndata_line_stroke_color : str | None = None\n\nThe color of the data line can be modified from its default \"#4682B4\" (\"steelblue\") color by supplying a color to the data_line_stroke_color= option.\n\ndata_line_stroke_width : int | None = None\n\nThe width of the connecting data line can be modified with data_line_stroke_width=. By default, a value of 4 (as in ‘4px’) is used.\n\ndata_area_fill_color : str | None = None\n\nThe fill color for the area that bounds the data points in line plot. The default is \"#FF0000\" (\"red\") but can be changed by providing a color value to data_area_fill_color=.\n\ndata_bar_stroke_color : str | list[str] | None = None\n\nThe color of the stroke used for the data bars can be modified from its default \"#3290CC\" color by supplying a color to data_bar_stroke_color=.\n\ndata_bar_stroke_width : int | list[int] | None = None\n\nThe width of the stroke used for the data bars can be modified with the data_bar_stroke_width= option. By default, a value of 4 (as in ‘4px’) is used.\n\ndata_bar_fill_color : str | list[str] | None = None\n\nBy default, all data bars have a fill color of \"#3FB5FF\". This can be changed for all data bars by providing a different color to data_bar_fill_color=. And, a list of different colors can be supplied so long as the length is equal to the number of data bars; the fill color values will be applied in order of left to right.\n\ndata_bar_negative_stroke_color : str | None = None\n\nThe color of the stroke used for the data bars that have negative values. The default color is \"#CC3243\" but this can be changed by supplying a color value to the data_bar_negative_stroke_color= option.\n\ndata_bar_negative_stroke_width : int | None = None\n\nThe width of the stroke used for negative value data bars. This has the same default as data_bar_stroke_width= with a value of 4 (as in ‘4px’). This can be changed by giving a numeric value to the data_bar_negative_stroke_width= option.\n\ndata_bar_negative_fill_color : str | None = None\n\nBy default, all negative data bars have a fill color of \"#D75A68\". This can however be changed by providing a color value to data_bar_negative_fill_color=.\n\nreference_line_color : str | None = None\n\nThe reference line will have a color of \"#75A8B0\" if it is set to appear. This color can be changed by providing a single color value to reference_line_color=.\n\nreference_area_fill_color : str | None = None\n\nIf a reference area has been defined and is visible it has by default a fill color of \"#A6E6F2\". This can be modified by declaring a color value in the reference_area_fill_color= option.\n\nvertical_guide_stroke_color : str | None = None\n\nVertical guides appear when hovering in the vicinity of data points. Their default color is \"#911EB4\" (a strong magenta color) and a fill opacity value of 0.4 is automatically applied to this. However, the base color can be changed with the vertical_guide_stroke_color= option.\n\nvertical_guide_stroke_width : int | None = None\n\nThe vertical guide’s stroke width, by default, is relatively large at 12 (this is ‘12px’). This is modifiable by setting a different value with vertical_guide_stroke_width=.\n\nshow_data_points : bool | None = None\n\nBy default, all data points in a nanoplot are shown but this layer can be hidden by setting show_data_points= to False.\n\nshow_data_line : bool | None = None\n\nThe data line connects data points together and it is shown by default. This data line layer can be hidden by setting show_data_line= to False.\n\nshow_data_area : bool | None = None\n\nThe data area layer is adjacent to the data points and the data line. It is shown by default but can be hidden with show_data_area=False.\n\nshow_reference_line : bool | None = None\n\nThe layer with a horizontal reference line appears underneath that of the data points and the data line. Like vertical guides, hovering over a reference will show its value. The reference line (if available) is shown by default but can be hidden by setting show_reference_line= to False.\n\nshow_reference_area : bool | None = None\n\nThe reference area appears at the very bottom of the layer stack, if it is available (i.e., defined in cols_nanoplot()). It will be shown in the default case but can be hidden by using show_reference_area=False.\n\nshow_vertical_guides : bool | None = None\n\nVertical guides appear when hovering over data points. This hidden layer is active by default but can be deactivated by using show_vertical_guides=False.\n\nshow_y_axis_guide : bool | None = None\n\nThe y-axis guide will appear when hovering over the far left side of a nanoplot. This hidden layer is active by default but can be deactivated by using show_y_axis_guide=False.\n\ninteractive_data_values : bool | None = None\n\nBy default, numeric data values will be shown only when the user interacts with certain regions of a nanoplot. This is because the values may be numerous (i.e., clutter the display when all are visible) and it can be argued that the values themselves are secondary to the presentation. However, for some types of plots (like horizontal bar plots), a persistent display of values alongside the plot marks may be desirable. By setting interactive_data_values=False we can opt for always displaying the data values alongside the plot components.\n\ny_val_fmt_fn : Callable[…, str] | None = None\n\nIf providing a function to y_val_fmt_fn=, customized formatting of the y values associated with the data points/bars is possible.\n\ny_axis_fmt_fn : Callable[…, str] | None = None\n\nA function supplied to y_axis_fmt_fn= will result in customized formatting of the y-axis label values.\n\ny_ref_line_fmt_fn : Callable[…, str] | None = None\n\nProviding a function for y_ref_line_fmt_fn= yields customized formatting of the reference line (if present).\n\ncurrency : str | None = None\n\nIf the values are to be displayed as currency values, supply either: (1) a 3-letter currency code (e.g., \"USD\" for U.S. Dollars, \"EUR\" for the Euro currency), or (2) a common currency name (e.g., \"dollar\", \"pound\", \"yen\", etc.)."

    "text": "Parameters\n\nx : X\n\nA list of values to be formatted.\n\ncurrency : str | None = None\n\nThe currency to use for the numeric value. This input can be supplied as a 3-letter currency code (e.g., \"USD\" for U.S. Dollars, \"EUR\" for the Euro currency).\n\nuse_subunits : bool = True\n\nAn option for whether the subunits portion of a currency value should be displayed. For example, with an input value of 273.81, the default formatting will produce \"$273.81\". Removing the subunits (with use_subunits = False) will give us \"$273\".\n\ndecimals : int | None = None\n\nThe decimals values corresponds to the exact number of decimal places to use. This value is optional as a currency has an intrinsic number of decimal places (i.e., the subunits). A value such as 2.34 can, for example, be formatted with 0 decimal places and if the currency used is \"USD\" it would result in \"$2\". With 4 decimal places, the formatted value becomes \"$2.3400\".\n\ndrop_trailing_dec_mark : bool = True\n\nA boolean value that determines whether decimal marks should always appear even if there are no decimal digits to display after formatting (e.g., 23 becomes 23. if False). By default trailing decimal marks are not shown.\n\naccounting : bool = False\n\nAn option to use accounting style for values. Normally, negative values will be shown with a minus sign but using accounting style will instead put any negative values in parentheses.\n\nuse_seps : bool = True\n\nThe use_seps option allows for the use of digit group separators. The type of digit group separator is set by sep_mark and overridden if a locale ID is provided to locale. This setting is True by default.\n\nscale_by : float = 1\n\nAll numeric values will be multiplied by the scale_by value before undergoing formatting. Since the default value is 1, no values will be changed unless a different multiplier value is supplied.\n\ncompact : bool = False\n\nWhether to use compact formatting. This is a boolean value that, when set to True, will format large numbers in a more compact form (e.g., 1,000,000 becomes 1M). This is False by default.\n\npattern : str = '{x}'\n\nA formatting pattern that allows for decoration of the formatted value. The formatted value is represented by the {x} (which can be used multiple times, if needed) and all other characters will be interpreted as string literals.\n\nsep_mark : str = ','\n\nThe string to use as a separator between groups of digits. For example, using sep_mark=\",\" with a value of 1000 would result in a formatted value of \"1,000\". This argument is ignored if a locale is supplied (i.e., is not None).\n\ndec_mark : str = '.'\n\nThe string to be used as the decimal mark. For example, using dec_mark=\",\" with the value 0.152 would result in a formatted value of \"0,152\"). This argument is ignored if a locale is supplied (i.e., is not None).\n\nforce_sign : bool = False\n\nShould the positive sign be shown for positive values (effectively showing a sign for all values except zero)? If so, use True for this option. The default is False, where only negative numbers will display a minus sign.\n\nplacement : str = 'left'\n\nThe placement of the currency symbol. This can be either be \"left\" (as in \"$450\") or \"right\" (which yields \"450$\").\n\nincl_space : bool = False\n\nAn option for whether to include a space between the value and the currency symbol. The default is to not introduce a space character.\n\nlocale : str | None = None\n\nAn optional locale identifier that can be used for formatting values according the locale’s rules. Examples include \"en\" for English (United States) and \"fr\" for French (France)."

    "section": "Parameters",
    "text": "Parameters\n\ncolumns : SelectExpr = None\n\nThe columns to target. Can either be a single column name or a series of column names provided in a list.\n\nrows : int | list[int] | None = None\n\nIn conjunction with columns=, we can specify which of their rows should undergo formatting. The default is all rows, resulting in all rows in targeted columns being formatted. Alternatively, we can supply a list of row indices.\n\ncurrency : str | None = None\n\nThe currency to use for the numeric value. This input can be supplied as a 3-letter currency code (e.g., \"USD\" for U.S. Dollars, \"EUR\" for the Euro currency).\n\nuse_subunits : bool = True\n\nAn option for whether the subunits portion of a currency value should be displayed. For example, with an input value of 273.81, the default formatting will produce \"$273.81\". Removing the subunits (with use_subunits = False) will give us \"$273\".\n\ndecimals : int | None = None\n\nThe decimals values corresponds to the exact number of decimal places to use. This value is optional as a currency has an intrinsic number of decimal places (i.e., the subunits). A value such as 2.34 can, for example, be formatted with 0 decimal places and if the currency used is \"USD\" it would result in \"$2\". With 4 decimal places, the formatted value becomes \"$2.3400\".\n\ndrop_trailing_dec_mark : bool = True\n\nA boolean value that determines whether decimal marks should always appear even if there are no decimal digits to display after formatting (e.g., 23 becomes 23. if False). By default trailing decimal marks are not shown.\n\nuse_seps : bool = True\n\nThe use_seps option allows for the use of digit group separators. The type of digit group separator is set by sep_mark and overridden if a locale ID is provided to locale. This setting is True by default.\n\naccounting : bool = False\n\nWhether to use accounting style, which wraps negative numbers in parentheses instead of using a minus sign.\n\nscale_by : float = 1\n\nAll numeric values will be multiplied by the scale_by value before undergoing formatting. Since the default value is 1, no values will be changed unless a different multiplier value is supplied.\n\ncompact : bool = False\n\nWhether to use compact formatting. This is a boolean value that, when set to True, will format large numbers in a more compact form (e.g., 1,000,000 becomes 1M). This is False by default.\n\npattern : str = '{x}'\n\nA formatting pattern that allows for decoration of the formatted value. The formatted value is represented by the {x} (which can be used multiple times, if needed) and all other characters will be interpreted as string literals.\n\nsep_mark : str = ','\n\nThe string to use as a separator between groups of digits. For example, using sep_mark=\",\" with a value of 1000 would result in a formatted value of \"1,000\". This argument is ignored if a locale is supplied (i.e., is not None).\n\ndec_mark : str = '.'\n\nThe string to be used as the decimal mark. For example, using dec_mark=\",\" with the value 0.152 would result in a formatted value of \"0,152\"). This argument is ignored if a locale is supplied (i.e., is not None).\n\nforce_sign : bool = False\n\nShould the positive sign be shown for positive values (effectively showing a sign for all values except zero)? If so, use True for this option. The default is False, where only negative numbers will display a minus sign.\n\nplacement : str = 'left'\n\nThe placement of the currency symbol. This can be either be \"left\" (as in \"$450\") or \"right\" (which yields \"450$\").\n\nincl_space : bool = False\n\nAn option for whether to include a space between the value and the currency symbol. The default is to not introduce a space character.\n\nlocale : str | None = None\n\nAn optional locale identifier that can be used for formatting values according the locale’s rules. Examples include \"en\" for English (United States) and \"fr\" for French (France)."

With this class, we supply the input data table and some basic options for creating a stub and row groups (with the rowname_col= and groupname_col= arguments).\n\n\n\nGT\nCreate a Great Tables object.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA table can contain a few useful components for conveying additional information. These include a header (with a titles and subtitle), a footer (with source notes), and additional areas for labels (row group labels, column spanner labels, the stubhead label). We can perform styling on targeted table locations with the tab_style() method.\n\n\n\nGT.tab_header\nAdd a table header.\n\n\nGT.tab_spanner\nInsert a spanner above a selection of column headings.\n\n\nGT.tab_spanner_delim\nInsert spanners by splitting column names with a delimiter.\n\n\nGT.tab_stub\nAdd a table stub, to emphasize row and group information.\n\n\nGT.tab_stubhead\nAdd label text to the stubhead.\n\n\nGT.tab_source_note\nAdd a source note citation.\n\n\nGT.tab_style\nAdd custom style to one or more cells\n\n\nGT.tab_options\nModify the table output options.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nColumns of data can be formatted with the fmt_*() methods. We can specify the rows of these columns quite precisely with the rows argument. We get to apply these methods exactly once to each data cell (last call wins). Need to do custom formatting? Use the fmt() method and define your own formatter.\n\n\n\nGT.fmt_number\nFormat numeric values.\n\n\nGT.fmt_integer\nFormat values as integers.\n\n\nGT.fmt_percent\nFormat values as a percentage.\n\n\nGT.fmt_scientific\nFormat values to scientific notation.\n\n\nGT.fmt_engineering\nFormat values to engineering notation.\n\n\nGT.fmt_currency\nFormat values as currencies.\n\n\nGT.fmt_bytes\nFormat values as bytes.\n\n\nGT.fmt_roman\nFormat values as Roman numerals.\n\n\nGT.fmt_date\nFormat values as dates.\n\n\nGT.fmt_time\nFormat values as times.\n\n\nGT.fmt_tf\nFormat True and False values\n\n\nGT.fmt_datetime\nFormat values as datetimes.\n\n\nGT.fmt_markdown\nFormat Markdown text.\n\n\nGT.fmt_units\nFormat measurement units.\n\n\nGT.fmt_image\nFormat image paths to generate images in cells.\n\n\nGT.fmt_icon\nUse icons within a table’s body cells.\n\n\nGT.fmt_flag\nGenerate flag icons for countries from their country codes.\n\n\nGT.fmt_nanoplot\nFormat data for nanoplot visualizations.\n\n\nGT.fmt\nSet a column format with a formatter function.\n\n\nGT.data_color\nPerform data cell colorization.\n\n\nGT.sub_missing\nSubstitute missing values in the table body.\n\n\nGT.sub_zero\nSubstitute zero values in the table body.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe cols_*() methods allow for modifications that act on entire columns. This includes alignment of the data in columns (cols_align()), hiding columns from view (cols_hide()), re-labeling the column labels (cols_label()), and moving columns around (with the cols_move*() methods).\n\n\n\nGT.cols_align\nSet the alignment of one or more columns.\n\n\nGT.cols_width\nSet the widths of columns.\n\n\nGT.cols_label\nRelabel one or more columns.\n\n\nGT.cols_label_rotate\nRotate the column label for one or more columns.\n\n\nGT.cols_move\nMove one or more columns.\n\n\nGT.cols_move_to_start\nMove one or more columns to the start.\n\n\nGT.cols_move_to_end\nMove one or more columns to the end.\n\n\nGT.cols_hide\nHide one or more columns.\n\n\nGT.cols_unhide\nUnhide one or more columns.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe grand_summary_rows() function will add rows to summarize data in your table, such as totals or averages.\n\n\n\nGT.grand_summary_rows\nAdd grand summary rows to the table.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLocation targeting is a powerful feature of Great Tables. It allows for the precise selection of table locations for styling (using the tab_style() method).

This set of values is calculated on the first of every month for 4 different northern hemisphere latitudes. For determination of afternoon values, the presented tabulated values are symmetric about noon.\nThe solar zenith angle (SZA) is one measure that helps to describe the sun’s path across the sky. It’s defined as the angle of the sun relative to a line perpendicular to the earth’s surface. It is useful to calculate the SZA in relation to the true solar time. True solar time relates to the position of the sun with respect to the observer, which is different depending on the exact longitude. For example, two hours before the sun crosses the meridian (the highest point it would reach that day) corresponds to a true solar time of 10 a.m. The SZA has a strong dependence on the observer’s latitude. For example, at a latitude of 50 degrees N at the start of January, the noontime SZA is 73.0 but a different observer at 20 degrees N would measure the noontime SZA to be 43.0 degrees.\n\n\nThis is a dataset with 816 rows and 4 columns.\n\nlatitude: The latitude in decimal degrees for the observations.\nmonth: The measurement month.

Each record represents a station, describing which Metro lines are serviced by the station, which other connections are available, and annual passenger volumes. Basic location information is provided for each station in terms where they reside on a municipal level, and, through latitude/longitude coordinates.\nThe system has 16 lines (numbered from 1 to 14, with two additional lines: 3bis and 7bis) and covers over 200 kilometers of track. The Metro runs on standard gauge tracks (1,435 mm) and operates using a variety of rolling stock, including rubber-tired trains and steel-wheeled trains (which are far more common).\nThe Metro is operated by the RATP, which also operates other transit systems in the region, including buses, trams, and the RER. The RER is an important component of the region’s transit infrastructure, and several RER stations have connectivity with the Metro. This integration allows passengers to transfer between those two systems seamlessly. The Metro also has connections to the Transilien rail network, tramway stations, several major train stations (e.g., Gare du Nord, Gare de l’Est, etc.), and many bus lines.\n\n\nThis is a dataset with 314 rows and 11 columns.\n\nname: The name of the station.\ncaption: In some cases, a station will have a caption that might describe a nearby place of interest.

The val_fmt_bytes() function allows for the formatting of byte sizes to either of two common representations: (1) with decimal units (powers of 1000, examples being \"kB\" and \"MB\"), and (2) with binary units (powers of 1024, examples being \"KiB\" and \"MiB\"). It is assumed the input numeric values represent the number of bytes and automatic truncation of values will occur. The numeric values will be scaled to be in the range of 1 to &lt;1000 and then decorated with the correct unit symbol according to the standard chosen. For more control over the formatting of byte sizes, we can use the following options:"

    "text": "Parameters\n\nx : X\n\nA list of values to be formatted.\n\nstandard : str = 'decimal'\n\nThe form of expressing large byte sizes is divided between: (1) decimal units (powers of 1000; e.g., \"kB\" and \"MB\"), and (2) binary units (powers of 1024; e.g., \"KiB\" and \"MiB\"). The default is to use decimal units with the \"decimal\" option. The alternative is to use binary units with the \"binary\" option.\n\ndecimals : int = 1\n\nThis corresponds to the exact number of decimal places to use. A value such as 2.34 can, for example, be formatted with 0 decimal places and it would result in \"2\". With 4 decimal places, the formatted value becomes \"2.3400\". The trailing zeros can be removed with drop_trailing_zeros=True.\n\ndrop_trailing_zeros : bool = True\n\nA boolean value that allows for removal of trailing zeros (those redundant zeros after the decimal mark).\n\ndrop_trailing_dec_mark : bool = True\n\nA boolean value that determines whether decimal marks should always appear even if there are no decimal digits to display after formatting (e.g., 23 becomes 23. if False). By default trailing decimal marks are not shown.\n\nuse_seps : bool = True\n\nThe use_seps option allows for the use of digit group separators. The type of digit group separator is set by sep_mark and overridden if a locale ID is provided to locale. This setting is True by default.\n\npattern : str = '{x}'\n\nA formatting pattern that allows for decoration of the formatted value. The formatted value is represented by the {x} (which can be used multiple times, if needed) and all other characters will be interpreted as string literals.\n\nsep_mark : str = ','\n\nThe string to use as a separator between groups of digits. For example, using sep_mark=\",\" with a value of 1000 would result in a formatted value of \"1,000\". This argument is ignored if a locale is supplied (i.e., is not None).\n\ndec_mark : str = '.'\n\nThe string to be used as the decimal mark. For example, using dec_mark=\",\" with the value 0.152 would result in a formatted value of \"0,152\"). This argument is ignored if a locale is supplied (i.e., is not None).\n\nforce_sign : bool = False\n\nShould the positive sign be shown for positive values (effectively showing a sign for all values except zero)? If so, use True for this option. The default is False, where only negative numbers will display a minus sign.\n\nincl_space : bool = True\n\nAn option for whether to include a space between the value and the currency symbol. The default is to not introduce a space character.\n\nlocale : str | None = None\n\nAn optional locale identifier that can be used for formatting values according the locale’s rules. Examples include \"en\" for English (United States) and \"fr\" for French (France)."

The notation here provides several conveniences for defining units, so as long as the values to be formatted conform to this syntax, you’ll obtain nicely-formatted inline units.

    "text": "How to use units notation\nThe Great Tables units notation involves a shorthand of writing units that feels familiar and is fine-tuned for the task at hand. Each unit is treated as a separate entity (parentheses and other symbols included) and the addition of subscript text and exponents is flexible and relatively easy to formulate. This is all best shown with examples:\n\n\"m/s\" and \"m / s\" both render as \"m/s\"\n\"m s^-1\" will appear with the \"-1\" exponent intact\n\"m /s\" gives the the same result, as \"/&lt;unit&gt;\" is equivalent to \"&lt;unit&gt;^-1\"\n\"E_h\" will render an \"E\" with the \"h\" subscript\n\"t_i^2.5\" provides a t with an \"i\" subscript and a \"2.5\" exponent\n\"m[_0^2]\" will use overstriking to set both scripts vertically\n\"g/L %C6H12O6%\" uses a chemical formula (enclosed in a pair of \"%\" characters) as a unit partial, and the formula will render correctly with subscripted numbers\nCommon units that are difficult to write using ASCII text may be implicitly converted to the correct characters (e.g., the \"u\" in \"ug\", \"um\", \"uL\", and \"umol\" will be converted to the Greek mu symbol; \"degC\" and \"degF\" will render a degree sign before the temperature unit)\nWe can transform shorthand symbol/unit names enclosed in \":\" (e.g., \":angstrom:\", \":ohm:\", etc.) into proper symbols\nGreek letters can added by enclosing the letter name in \":\"; you can use lowercase letters (e.g., \":beta:\", \":sigma:\", etc.) and uppercase letters too (e.g., \":Alpha:\", \":Zeta:\", etc.)\nThe components of a unit (unit name, subscript, and exponent) can be fully or partially italicized/emboldened by surrounding text with \"*\" or \"**\""

Here, the preference for typesetting measurement units is to have positive and negative exponents (e.g., not \"&lt;unit_1&gt; / &lt;unit_2&gt;\" but rather \"&lt;unit_1&gt; &lt;unit_2&gt;^-1\").\n\nfrom great_tables.data import constants\nimport polars as pl\nimport polars.selectors as cs\n\nconstants_mini = (\n    pl.from_pandas(constants)\n    .filter(pl.col(\"name\").str.contains(\"molar\")).sort(\"value\")\n    .with_columns(\n        name=pl.col(\"name\")\n        .str.to_titlecase()\n        .str.replace(\"Kpa\", \"kpa\")\n        .str.replace(\"Of\", \"of\")\n    )\n)\n\n(\n    GT(constants_mini)\n    .cols_hide(columns=[\"uncert\", \"sf_value\", \"sf_uncert\"])\n    .fmt_units(columns=\"units\")\n    .fmt_scientific(columns=\"value\", decimals=3)\n    .tab_header(title=\"Physical Constants Having a Molar Basis\")\n    .tab_options(column_labels_hidden=True)\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n    Physical Constants Having a Molar Basis\n  \n\n\n\n  \n    Molar Planck Constant\n    3.990 × 10−10\n    J Hz−1 mol−1\n  \n  \n    Electron Molar Mass\n    5.486 × 10−7\n    kg mol−1\n  \n  \n    Molar Volume of Silicon\n    1.206 × 10−5\n    m3 mol−1\n  \n  \n    Muon Molar Mass\n    1.134 × 10−4\n    kg mol−1\n  \n  \n    Molar Mass Constant\n    1.000 × 10−3\n    kg mol−1\n  \n  \n    Proton Molar Mass\n    1.007 × 10−3\n    kg mol−1\n  \n  \n    Neutron Molar Mass\n    1.009 × 10−3\n    kg mol−1\n  \n  \n    Tau Molar Mass\n    1.908 × 10−3\n    kg mol−1\n  \n  \n    Deuteron Molar Mass\n    2.014 × 10−3\n    kg mol−1\n  \n  \n    Helion Molar Mass\n    3.015 × 10−3\n    kg mol−1\n  \n  \n    Triton Molar Mass\n    3.016 × 10−3\n    kg mol−1\n  \n  \n    Alpha Particle Molar Mass\n    4.002 × 10−3\n    kg mol−1\n  \n  \n    Molar Mass of Carbon-12\n    1.200 × 10−2\n    kg mol−1\n  \n  \n    Molar Volume of Ideal Gas (273.15 K, 101.325 kpa)\n    2.241 × 10−2\n    m3 mol−1\n  \n  \n    Molar Volume of Ideal Gas (273.15 K, 100 kpa)\n    2.271 × 10−2\n    m3 mol−1\n  \n  \n    Molar Gas Constant\n    8.314\n    J mol−1 K−1"

The type of digit group separator is set by sep_mark and overridden if a locale ID is provided to locale. This setting is True by default.\n\naccounting : bool = False\n\nAn option to use accounting style for values. Normally, negative values will be shown with a minus sign but using accounting style will instead put any negative values in parentheses.\n\nscale_by : float = 1\n\nAll numeric values will be multiplied by the scale_by value before undergoing formatting. Since the default value is 1, no values will be changed unless a different multiplier value is supplied.\n\ncompact : bool = False\n\nA boolean value that allows for compact formatting of numeric values. Values will be scaled and decorated with the appropriate suffixes (e.g., 1230 becomes 1K, and 1230000 becomes 1M). The compact option is False by default.\n\npattern : str = '{x}'\n\nA formatting pattern that allows for decoration of the formatted value. The formatted value is represented by the {x} (which can be used multiple times, if needed) and all other characters will be interpreted as string literals.\n\nsep_mark : str = ','\n\nThe string to use as a separator between groups of digits. For example, using sep_mark=\",\" with a value of 1000 would result in a formatted value of \"1,000\". This argument is ignored if a locale is supplied (i.e., is not None).\n\nforce_sign : bool = False\n\nShould the positive sign be shown for positive values (effectively showing a sign for all values except zero)? If so, use True for this option. The default is False, where only negative numbers will display a minus sign.\n\nlocale : str | None = None\n\nAn optional locale identifier that can be used for formatting values according the locale’s rules. Examples include \"en\" for English (United States) and \"fr\" for French (France)."

    "text": "Parameters\n\nx : X\n\nA list of values to be formatted.\n\ndecimals : int = 2\n\nThe decimals values corresponds to the exact number of decimal places to use. A value such as 2.34 can, for example, be formatted with 0 decimal places and it would result in \"2\". With 4 decimal places, the formatted value becomes \"2.3400\". The trailing zeros can be removed with drop_trailing_zeros=True.\n\nn_sigfig : int | None = None\n\nA option to format numbers to n significant figures. By default, this is None and thus number values will be formatted according to the number of decimal places set via decimals. If opting to format according to the rules of significant figures, n_sigfig must be a number greater than or equal to 1. Any values passed to the decimals and drop_trailing_zeros arguments will be ignored.\n\ndrop_trailing_zeros : bool = False\n\nA boolean value that allows for removal of trailing zeros (those redundant zeros after the decimal mark).\n\ndrop_trailing_dec_mark : bool = True\n\nA boolean value that determines whether decimal marks should always appear even if there are no decimal digits to display after formatting (e.g., 23 becomes 23. if False). By default trailing decimal marks are not shown.\n\nscale_by : float = 1\n\nAll numeric values will be multiplied by the scale_by value before undergoing formatting. Since the default value is 1, no values will be changed unless a different multiplier value is supplied.\n\nexp_style : str = 'x10n'\n\nStyle of formatting to use for the scientific notation formatting. By default this is \"x10n\" but other options include using a single letter (e.g., \"e\", \"E\", etc.), a letter followed by a \"1\" to signal a minimum digit width of one, or \"low-ten\" for using a stylized \"10\" marker.\n\npattern : str = '{x}'\n\nA formatting pattern that allows for decoration of the formatted value. The formatted value is represented by the {x} (which can be used multiple times, if needed) and all other characters will be interpreted as string literals.\n\nsep_mark : str = ','\n\nThe string to use as a separator between groups of digits. For example, using sep_mark=\",\" with a value of 1000 would result in a formatted value of \"1,000\". This argument is ignored if a locale is supplied (i.e., is not None).\n\ndec_mark : str = '.'\n\nThe string to be used as the decimal mark. For example, using dec_mark=\",\" with the value 0.152 would result in a formatted value of \"0,152\"). This argument is ignored if a locale is supplied (i.e., is not None).\n\nforce_sign_m : bool = False\n\nShould the plus sign be shown for positive values of the mantissa (first component)? This would effectively show a sign for all values except zero on the first numeric component of the notation. If so, use True (the default for this is False), where only negative numbers will display a sign.\n\nforce_sign_n : bool = False\n\nShould the plus sign be shown for positive values of the exponent (second component)? This would effectively show a sign for all values except zero on the second numeric component of the notation. If so, use True (the default for this is False), where only negative numbers will display a sign.\n\nlocale : str | None = None\n\nAn optional locale identifier that can be used for formatting values according the locale’s rules. Examples include \"en\" for English (United States) and \"fr\" for French (France)."

Numeric columns will use ‘numeric’ methodology for color scaling whereas string-based columns will use the ‘factor’ methodology. The text color undergoes an automatic modification that maximizes contrast (since autocolor_text=True by default).\nWe can target specific colors and apply color to just those columns. Let’s do that and also supply palette= values of \"red\" and \"green\".\n\nGT(exibble).data_color(\n    columns=[\"num\", \"currency\"],\n    palette=[\"red\", \"green\"]\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  num\n  char\n  fctr\n  date\n  time\n  datetime\n  currency\n  row\n  group\n\n\n\n  \n    0.1111\n    apricot\n    one\n    2015-01-15\n    13:35\n    2018-01-01 02:22\n    49.95\n    row_1\n    grp_a\n  \n  \n    2.222\n    banana\n    two\n    2015-02-15\n    14:40\n    2018-02-02 14:33\n    17.95\n    row_2\n    grp_a\n  \n  \n    33.33\n    coconut\n    three\n    2015-03-15\n    15:45\n    2018-03-03 03:44\n    1.39\n    row_3\n    grp_a\n  \n  \n    444.4\n    durian\n    four\n    2015-04-15\n    16:50\n    2018-04-04 15:55\n    65100.0\n    row_4\n    grp_a\n  \n  \n    5550.0\n    \n    five\n    2015-05-15\n    17:55\n    2018-05-05 04:00\n    1325.81\n    row_5\n    grp_b\n  \n  \n    \n    fig\n    six\n    2015-06-15\n    \n    2018-06-06 16:11\n    13.255\n    row_6\n    grp_b\n  \n  \n    777000.0\n    grapefruit\n    seven\n    \n    19:10\n    2018-07-07 05:22\n    \n    row_7\n    grp_b\n  \n  \n    8880000.0\n    honeydew\n    eight\n    2015-08-15\n    20:20\n    \n    0.44\n    row_8\n    grp_b\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n        \n\n\nWith those options in place we see that only the numeric columns num and currency received color treatments. Moreover, the palette colors were mapped to the lower and upper limits of the data in each column; interpolated colors were used for the values in between the numeric limits of the two columns.\nWe can manually set the limits of the data with the domain= argument (which is preferable in most cases). Let’s colorize just the currency column and set domain=[0, 50]. Any values that are either missing or lie outside of the domain will be colorized with the na_color= color (so we’ll set that to \"lightgray\").\n\nGT(exibble).data_color(\n    columns=\"currency\",\n    palette=[\"red\", \"green\"],\n    domain=[0, 50],\n    na_color=\"lightgray\"\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  num\n  char\n  fctr\n  date\n  time\n  datetime\n  currency\n  row\n  group\n\n\n\n  \n    0.1111\n    apricot\n    one\n    2015-01-15\n    13:35\n    2018-01-01 02:22\n    49.95\n    row_1\n    grp_a\n  \n  \n    2.222\n    banana\n    two\n    2015-02-15\n    14:40\n    2018-02-02 14:33\n    17.95\n    row_2\n    grp_a\n  \n  \n    33.33\n    coconut\n    three\n    2015-03-15\n    15:45\n    2018-03-03 03:44\n    1.39\n    row_3\n    grp_a\n  \n  \n    444.4\n    durian\n    four\n    2015-04-15\n    16:50\n    2018-04-04 15:55\n    65100.0\n    row_4\n    grp_a\n  \n  \n    5550.0\n    \n    five\n    2015-05-15\n    17:55\n    2018-05-05 04:00\n    1325.81\n    row_5\n    grp_b\n  \n  \n    \n    fig\n    six\n    2015-06-15\n    \n    2018-06-06 16:11\n    13.255\n    row_6\n    grp_b\n  \n  \n    777000.0\n    grapefruit\n    seven\n    \n    19:10\n    2018-07-07 05:22\n    \n    row_7\n    grp_b\n  \n  \n    8880000.0\n    honeydew\n    eight\n    2015-08-15\n    20:20\n    \n    0.44\n    row_8\n    grp_b"

    "text": "Parameters\n\nx : X\n\nA list of values to be formatted.\n\ndecimals : int = 2\n\nThe decimals values corresponds to the exact number of decimal places to use. A value such as 2.34 can, for example, be formatted with 0 decimal places and it would result in \"2\". With 4 decimal places, the formatted value becomes \"2.3400\". The trailing zeros can be removed with drop_trailing_zeros=True. If you always need decimals = 0, the val_fmt_integer() function should be considered.\n\nn_sigfig : int | None = None\n\nA option to format numbers to n significant figures. By default, this is None and thus number values will be formatted according to the number of decimal places set via decimals. If opting to format according to the rules of significant figures, n_sigfig must be a number greater than or equal to 1. Any values passed to the decimals and drop_trailing_zeros arguments will be ignored.\n\ndrop_trailing_zeros : bool = False\n\nA boolean value that allows for removal of trailing zeros (those redundant zeros after the decimal mark).\n\ndrop_trailing_dec_mark : bool = True\n\nA boolean value that determines whether decimal marks should always appear even if there are no decimal digits to display after formatting (e.g., 23 becomes 23. if False). By default trailing decimal marks are not shown.\n\nuse_seps : bool = True\n\nThe use_seps option allows for the use of digit group separators. The type of digit group separator is set by sep_mark and overridden if a locale ID is provided to locale. This setting is True by default.\n\naccounting : bool = False\n\nAn option to use accounting style for values. Normally, negative values will be shown with a minus sign but using accounting style will instead put any negative values in parentheses.\n\nscale_by : float = 1\n\nAll numeric values will be multiplied by the scale_by value before undergoing formatting. Since the default value is 1, no values will be changed unless a different multiplier value is supplied.\n\ncompact : bool = False\n\nA boolean value that allows for compact formatting of numeric values. Values will be scaled and decorated with the appropriate suffixes (e.g., 1230 becomes 1.23K, and 1230000 becomes 1.23M). The compact option is False by default.\n\npattern : str = '{x}'\n\nA formatting pattern that allows for decoration of the formatted value. The formatted value is represented by the {x} (which can be used multiple times, if needed) and all other characters will be interpreted as string literals.\n\nsep_mark : str = ','\n\nThe string to use as a separator between groups of digits. For example, using sep_mark=\",\" with a value of 1000 would result in a formatted value of \"1,000\". This argument is ignored if a locale is supplied (i.e., is not None).\n\ndec_mark : str = '.'\n\nThe string to be used as the decimal mark. For example, using dec_mark=\",\" with the value 0.152 would result in a formatted value of \"0,152\"). This argument is ignored if a locale is supplied (i.e., is not None).\n\nforce_sign : bool = False\n\nShould the positive sign be shown for positive values (effectively showing a sign for all values except zero)? If so, use True for this option. The default is False, where only negative numbers will display a minus sign.\n\nlocale : str | None = None\n\nAn optional locale identifier that can be used for formatting values according the locale’s rules. Examples include \"en\" for English (United States) and \"fr\" for French (France)."

Can either be a single column name or a series of column names provided in a list.\n\nrows : int | list[int] | None = None\n\nIn conjunction with columns=, we can specify which of their rows should undergo formatting. The default is all rows, resulting in all rows in targeted columns being formatted. Alternatively, we can supply a list of row indices.\n\nplot_type : PlotType = 'line'\n\nNanoplots can either take the form of a line plot (using \"line\") or a bar plot (with \"bar\"). A line plot, by default, contains layers for a data line, data points, and a data area. With a bar plot, the always visible layer is that of the data bars.\n\nplot_height : str = '2em'\n\nThe height of the nanoplots. The default here is a sensible value of \"2em\".\n\nmissing_vals : MissingVals = 'marker'\n\nIf missing values are encountered within the input data, there are three strategies available for their handling: (1) \"gap\" will show data gaps at the sites of missing data, where data lines will have discontinuities and bar plots will have missing bars; (2) \"marker\" will behave like \"gap\" but show prominent visual marks at the missing data locations; (3) \"zero\" will replace missing values with zero values; and (4) \"remove\" will remove any incoming missing values.\n\nautoscale : bool = False\n\nUsing autoscale=True will ensure that the bounds of all nanoplots produced are based on the limits of data combined from all input rows. This will result in a shared scale across all of the nanoplots (for y- and x-axis data), which is useful in those cases where the nanoplot data should be compared across rows.\n\nreference_line : str | int | float | None = None\n\nA reference line requires a single input to define the line. It could be a numeric value, applied to all nanoplots generated. Or, the input can be one of the following for generating the line from the underlying data: (1) \"mean\", (2) \"median\", (3) \"min\", (4) \"max\", (5) \"q1\", (6) \"q3\", (7) \"first\", or (8) \"last\".\n\nreference_area : list[Any] | None = None\n\nA reference area requires a list of two values for defining bottom and top boundaries (in the y direction) for a rectangular area. The types of values supplied are the same as those expected for reference_line=, which is either a numeric value or one of the following keywords for the generation of the value: (1) \"mean\", (2) \"median\", (3) \"min\", (4) \"max\", (5) \"q1\", (6) \"q3\", (7) \"first\", or (8) \"last\". Input can either be a vector or list with two elements.\n\nexpand_x : list[int] | list[float] | list[int | float] | None = None\n\nShould you need to have plots expand in the x direction, provide one or more values to expand_x=. Any values provided that are outside of the range of x-value data provided to the plot will result in a x-scale expansion.\n\nexpand_y : list[int] | list[float] | list[int | float] | None = None\n\nSimilar to expand_x=, one can have plots expand in the y direction. To make this happen, provide one or more values to expand_y=. If any of the provided values are outside of the range of y-value data provided, the plot will result in a y-scale expansion.\n\noptions : dict[str, Any] | None = None\n\nBy using the nanoplot_options() helper function here, you can alter the layout and styling of the nanoplots in the new column."

One such group of graphics involves iconography representing different countries, and the fmt_flag() method helps with inserting a flag icon (or multiple) in body cells. To make this work seamlessly, the input cells need to contain some reference to a country, and this can be in the form of a 2- or 3-letter ISO 3166-1 country code (e.g., Egypt has the \"EG\" country code). This method will parse the targeted body cells for those codes and insert the appropriate flag graphics.\nMultiple flags can be included per cell by separating country codes with commas (e.g., \"GB,TT\").

The default is all rows, resulting in all rows in targeted columns being formatted. Alternatively, we can supply a list of row indices.\n\ndecimals : int = 2\n\nThe decimals values corresponds to the exact number of decimal places to use. A value such as 2.34 can, for example, be formatted with 0 decimal places and it would result in \"2\". With 4 decimal places, the formatted value becomes \"2.3400\". The trailing zeros can be removed with drop_trailing_zeros=True.\n\nn_sigfig : int | None = None\n\nA option to format numbers to n significant figures. By default, this is None and thus number values will be formatted according to the number of decimal places set via decimals. If opting to format according to the rules of significant figures, n_sigfig must be a number greater than or equal to 1. Any values passed to the decimals and drop_trailing_zeros arguments will be ignored.\n\ndrop_trailing_zeros : bool = False\n\nA boolean value that allows for removal of trailing zeros (those redundant zeros after the decimal mark).\n\ndrop_trailing_dec_mark : bool = True\n\nA boolean value that determines whether decimal marks should always appear even if there are no decimal digits to display after formatting (e.g., 23 becomes 23. if False). By default trailing decimal marks are not shown.\n\nscale_by : float = 1\n\nAll numeric values will be multiplied by the scale_by value before undergoing formatting. Since the default value is 1, no values will be changed unless a different multiplier value is supplied.\n\nexp_style : str = 'x10n'\n\nStyle of formatting to use for the scientific notation formatting. By default this is \"x10n\" but other options include using a single letter (e.g., \"e\", \"E\", etc.), a letter followed by a \"1\" to signal a minimum digit width of one, or \"low-ten\" for using a stylized \"10\" marker.\n\npattern : str = '{x}'\n\nA formatting pattern that allows for decoration of the formatted value. The formatted value is represented by the {x} (which can be used multiple times, if needed) and all other characters will be interpreted as string literals.\n\ndec_mark : str = '.'\n\nThe string to be used as the decimal mark. For example, using dec_mark=\",\" with the value 0.152 would result in a formatted value of \"0,152\"). This argument is ignored if a locale is supplied (i.e., is not None).\n\nforce_sign_m : bool = False\n\nShould the plus sign be shown for positive values of the mantissa (first component)? This would effectively show a sign for all values except zero on the first numeric component of the notation. If so, use True (the default for this is False), where only negative numbers will display a sign.\n\nforce_sign_n : bool = False\n\nShould the plus sign be shown for positive values of the exponent (second component)? This would effectively show a sign for all values except zero on the second numeric component of the notation. If so, use True (the default for this is False), where only negative numbers will display a sign.\n\nlocale : str | None = None\n\nAn optional locale identifier that can be used for formatting values according the locale’s rules.

The fmt_bytes() method allows for the formatting of byte sizes to either of two common representations: (1) with decimal units (powers of 1000, examples being \"kB\" and \"MB\"), and (2) with binary units (powers of 1024, examples being \"KiB\" and \"MiB\"). It is assumed the input numeric values represent the number of bytes and automatic truncation of values will occur. The numeric values will be scaled to be in the range of 1 to &lt;1000 and then decorated with the correct unit symbol according to the standard chosen. For more control over the formatting of byte sizes, we can use the following options:"

Can either be a single column name or a series of column names provided in a list.\n\nrows : int | list[int] | None = None\n\nIn conjunction with columns=, we can specify which of their rows should undergo formatting. The default is all rows, resulting in all rows in targeted columns being formatted. Alternatively, we can supply a list of row indices.\n\nstandard : str = 'decimal'\n\nThe form of expressing large byte sizes is divided between: (1) decimal units (powers of 1000; e.g., \"kB\" and \"MB\"), and (2) binary units (powers of 1024; e.g., \"KiB\" and \"MiB\"). The default is to use decimal units with the \"decimal\" option. The alternative is to use binary units with the \"binary\" option.\n\ndecimals : int = 1\n\nThis corresponds to the exact number of decimal places to use. A value such as 2.34 can, for example, be formatted with 0 decimal places and it would result in \"2\". With 4 decimal places, the formatted value becomes \"2.3400\". The trailing zeros can be removed with drop_trailing_zeros=True.\n\ndrop_trailing_zeros : bool = True\n\nA boolean value that allows for removal of trailing zeros (those redundant zeros after the decimal mark).\n\ndrop_trailing_dec_mark : bool = True\n\nA boolean value that determines whether decimal marks should always appear even if there are no decimal digits to display after formatting (e.g., 23 becomes 23. if False). By default trailing decimal marks are not shown.\n\nuse_seps : bool = True\n\nThe use_seps option allows for the use of digit group separators. The type of digit group separator is set by sep_mark and overridden if a locale ID is provided to locale. This setting is True by default.\n\npattern : str = '{x}'\n\nA formatting pattern that allows for decoration of the formatted value. The formatted value is represented by the {x} (which can be used multiple times, if needed) and all other characters will be interpreted as string literals.\n\nsep_mark : str = ','\n\nThe string to use as a separator between groups of digits. For example, using sep_mark=\",\" with a value of 1000 would result in a formatted value of \"1,000\". This argument is ignored if a locale is supplied (i.e., is not None).\n\ndec_mark : str = '.'\n\nThe string to be used as the decimal mark. For example, using dec_mark=\",\" with the value 0.152 would result in a formatted value of \"0,152\"). This argument is ignored if a locale is supplied (i.e., is not None).\n\nforce_sign : bool = False\n\nShould the positive sign be shown for positive values (effectively showing a sign for all values except zero)? If so, use True for this option. The default is False, where only negative numbers will display a minus sign.\n\nincl_space : bool = True\n\nAn option for whether to include a space between the value and the currency symbol. The default is to not introduce a space character.\n\nlocale : str | None = None\n\nAn optional locale identifier that can be used for formatting values according the locale’s rules. Examples include \"en\" for English (United States) and \"fr\" for French (France)."

If the PR is an enhancement, detail how the change would make things better for package users. Bugfix PRs also require some explanation about the bug and how the proposed fix will remove that bug. A great way to illustrate the bug is to include an MRE. While all this upfront work prior to preparing a PR can be time-consuming it opens a line of communication with the package authors and the community, perhaps leading to a better enhancement or more effective fixes!\nOnce there is consensus that a PR based on the issue would be helpful, adhering to the following process will make things proceed more quickly:\n\nCreate a separate Git branch for each PR\nLook at the build status badges before and after making changes; these badges are available in the package README\nThe Great Tables package follows the Style Guide for Python Code so please adopt those guidelines in your submitted code as best as possible\nComment your code, particularly in those hard-to-understand areas\nAdd test cases that cover the changes made in the PR; having tests for any new codepaths will help guard against regressions\n\n\n\nSetting Up Your Development Environment\nTo set up your development environment, you can follow these steps:\n\nClone the posit-dev/great-tables repository\nCreate a virtual environment for the folder\nInstall the package in editable mode with pip install -e . from the root of the project folder\nInstall the development dependencies with pip install .[dev] (have a look at the pyproject.toml file for the list of development dependencies)\n\nOur documentation use quartodoc which in turn requires a local install of the Quarto CLI. To install Quarto, go to https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/ to get the latest build for your platform.\nWe also use ruff for linting and formatting (this is part of our development dependencies). If using VS Code as your editor, it may be useful to install the Ruff extension. This will make it so any commits will pass the pre-commit checks. You can verify that any changes pass all pre-commit checks by running pre-commit run --all-files.\nIf you are planning to investigate or submit a PR concerning the generation of table images, you need to install additional dependencies (seleniumandPillow) and this can be done by using pip install .[all].\n\n\nBuilding the Documentation Locally\nBuilding the documentation can be done with make docs-build from the root of the project folder. Locally building the documentation site is useful when you want to see how your changes will look during iteration. The site will be built in the docs/_site folder.\n\n\nRunning Tests Locally\nThe tests are located in the tests folder and we use pytest for running them. To run all of the tests, use make test. If you want to run a specific test file, you can use pytest tests/test_file.py.\nIf you create new tests involving snapshots, please ensure that the resulting snapshots are relatively small. After adding snapshots, use make test-update (this runs pytest --snapshot-update). A subsequent use of make test should pass without any issues.",

As long as they are in ISO 8601 form, the fmt_date() and fmt_time() methods can be used to format such values.

    "text": "Arguments Common to Several Formatting Methods/Functions\nWhile we can use the fmt_*() methods on a table, we can also use the functional versions of these methods on scalar values or lists of values. These variants exist within the vals module. While arguments across these functions and their corresponding method aren’t exactly the same, there are nonetheless many arguments that are shared amongst them. Here are a few examples:\n\ndecimals=: set a fixed precision of decimal places\nsep_mark=, dec_mark=: set digit separators and the decimal symbol (defaults are \",\" and \".\")\nscale_by=: we can choose to scale targeted values by a multiplier value\ncompact=: larger figures (thousands, millions, etc.) can be autoscaled and decorated with the appropriate suffixes (e.g., \"10000\" becomes \"10K\")\npattern=: option to use a text pattern for decoration of the formatted values\nlocale=: providing a locale ID (e.g., \"en\", \"fr\", \"de-AT\", etc.) will result in numeric formatting specific to the chosen locale\n\nHere are a number of examples that use vals.fmt_number().\n\nfmt_number_1 = vals.fmt_number([1.64, 3.26, 3000.63, 236742.37])\nfmt_number_2 = vals.fmt_number([1.64, 3.26, 3000.63, 236742.37], compact=True)\nfmt_number_3 = vals.fmt_number([1.64, 3.26, 3000.63, 236742.37], decimals=3)\nfmt_number_4 = vals.fmt_number([1.64, 3.26, 3000.63, 236742.37], pattern=\"[{x}]\")\nfmt_number_5 = vals.fmt_number([1.64, 3.26, 3000.63, 236742.37], locale=\"es\")\n\nprint(fmt_number_1, fmt_number_2, fmt_number_3, fmt_number_4, fmt_number_5, sep=\"\\n\")\n\n['1.64', '3.26', '3,000.63', '236,742.37']\n['1.64', '3.26', '3.00K', '236.74K']\n['1.640', '3.260', '3,000.630', '236,742.370']\n['[1.64]', '[3.26]', '[3,000.63]', '[236,742.37]']\n['1,64', '3,26', '3.000,63', '236.742,37']\n\n\nScientific notation can be done with vals.fmt_scientific().\n\nfmt_sci_1 = vals.fmt_scientific([0.00064, 7.353, 863454.63])\nfmt_sci_2 = vals.fmt_scientific([1.64, 3.26, 3000.63], decimals=3)\nfmt_sci_3 = vals.fmt_scientific([1.64, 3.26, 3000.63], exp_style=\"E\")\nfmt_sci_4 = vals.fmt_scientific([1.64, 3.26, 3000.63], locale=\"de\")\n\nprint(fmt_sci_1, fmt_sci_2, fmt_sci_3, fmt_sci_4, sep=\"\\n\")\n\n[\"6.40 × 10&lt;sup style='font-size: 65%;'&gt;−4&lt;/sup&gt;\", '7.35', \"8.63 × 10&lt;sup style='font-size: 65%;'&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;\"]\n['1.640', '3.260', \"3.001 × 10&lt;sup style='font-size: 65%;'&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;\"]\n['1.64E00', '3.26E00', '3.00E03']\n['1,64', '3,26', \"3,00 × 10&lt;sup style='font-size: 65%;'&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;\"]\n\n\nDates and times are handled with vals.fmt_date() and vals.fmt_time().\n\nfmt_date_1 = vals.fmt_date(\n    [\"2015-03-15\", \"2017-08-18\", \"2020-04-12\"], date_style=\"wday_month_day_year\"\n)\nfmt_date_2 = vals.fmt_date([\"2015-03-15\", \"2017-08-18\", \"2020-04-12\"], date_style=\"month_day_year\")\nfmt_time_1 = vals.fmt_time([\"23:03\", \"00:55\", \"08:23\"], time_style=\"h_m_p\")\nfmt_time_2 = vals.fmt_time([\"23:03\", \"00:55\", \"08:23\"], time_style=\"h_p\")\n\nprint(fmt_date_1, fmt_date_2, fmt_time_1, fmt_time_2, sep=\"\\n\")\n\n['Sunday, March 15, 2015', 'Friday, August 18, 2017', 'Sunday, April 12, 2020']\n['March 15, 2015', 'August 18, 2017', 'April 12, 2020']\n['11:03 PM', '12:55 AM', '8:23 AM']\n['11 PM', '12 AM', '8 AM']\n\n\nSometimes it’s easier and more convenient to experiment with formatting using the formatting functions in the vals module.

    "text": "The way that we add components like the Table Header and source notes in the Table Footer is to use the tab_*() family of methods. A Table Header is easy to add so let’s see how the previous table looks with a title and a subtitle. We can add this component using the tab_header() method:\n\nfrom great_tables import GT, md, html\nfrom great_tables.data import islands\n\nislands_mini = islands.head(10)\n\n# Make a display table with the `islands_tbl` table;\n# put a heading just above the column labels\n(\n    GT(islands_mini)\n    .tab_header(\n        title = \"Large Landmasses of the World\",\n        subtitle = \"The top ten largest are presented\"\n    )\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n    Large Landmasses of the World\n  \n  \n    The top ten largest are presented\n  \n\n  name\n  size\n\n\n\n  \n    Africa\n    11506\n  \n  \n    Antarctica\n    5500\n  \n  \n    Asia\n    16988\n  \n  \n    Australia\n    2968\n  \n  \n    Axel Heiberg\n    16\n  \n  \n    Baffin\n    184\n  \n  \n    Banks\n    23\n  \n  \n    Borneo\n    280\n  \n  \n    Britain\n    84\n  \n  \n    Celebes\n    73\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n        \n\n\nThe Header table component provides an opportunity to describe the data that’s presented. Using subtitle= allows us to insert a subtitle, which is an optional part of the Header. We may also style the title= and subtitle= using Markdown! We do this by wrapping the values passed to title= or subtitle= with the md() helper function (we may also use html() in a similar fashion). Here is an example with the table data truncated for brevity:\n\n# Make a display table with the `islands_tbl` table;\n# put a heading just above the column labels\ngt_tbl = (\n    GT(islands.head(2))\n    .tab_header(\n        title = md(\"Large Landmasses of the *World* &#x1F310;\"),\n        subtitle = md(\"The top **ten** largest are presented\")\n    )\n)\n\ngt_tbl\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n    Large Landmasses of the World 🌐\n  \n  \n    The top ten largest are presented\n  \n\n  name\n  size\n\n\n\n  \n    Africa\n    11506\n  \n  \n    Antarctica\n    5500\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n        \n\n\nA source note can be added to the table’s Footer through use of the tab_source_note() method. It works in the same way as tab_header() (it also allows for Markdown inputs) except it can be called multiple times—each invocation results in the addition of a source note.\n\n# Display the `islands_tbl` data with a heading and two source notes\n(\n    gt_tbl\n    .tab_source_note(\n        source_note = \"Source: The World Almanac and Book of Facts, 1975, page 406.\"\n    )\n    .tab_source_note(\n        source_note = md(\"Reference: McNeil, D.

For example, the table-making code below applies a yellow background color to specific cells.\n\ngt_air.tab_style(\n    style=style.fill(color=\"yellow\"),\n    locations=loc.body(columns=\"Temp\", rows=[1, 2])\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  Ozone\n  Solar_R\n  Wind\n  Temp\n  Month\n  Day\n\n\n\n  \n    41.0\n    190.0\n    7.4\n    67\n    5\n    1\n  \n  \n    36.0\n    118.0\n    8.0\n    72\n    5\n    2\n  \n  \n    12.0\n    149.0\n    12.6\n    74\n    5\n    3\n  \n  \n    18.0\n    313.0\n    11.5\n    62\n    5\n    4\n  \n  \n    \n    \n    14.3\n    56\n    5\n    5\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n        \n\n\nThere are two important arguments to tab_style(): style= and locations=. We are calling a specific function for each of these:\n\nstyle.fill(): the type of style to apply. In this case the fill (or background color).\nloc.body(): the area we want to style. In this case, it’s the table body with specific columns and rows specified.\n\nIn addition to style.fill(), several other styling functions exist. We’ll look at styling borders and text in the following sections.\n\nCustomizing Borders\nLet’s use style.borders() to place borders around targeted cells. In this next example, the table has a red dashed border above two rows.\n\ngt_air.tab_style(\n    style=style.borders(sides=\"top\", color=\"red\", style=\"dashed\", weight=\"3px\"),\n    locations=loc.body(rows=[1, 2])\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  Ozone\n  Solar_R\n  Wind\n  Temp\n  Month\n  Day\n\n\n\n  \n    41.0\n    190.0\n    7.4\n    67\n    5\n    1\n  \n  \n    36.0\n    118.0\n    8.0\n    72\n    5\n    2\n  \n  \n    12.0\n    149.0\n    12.6\n    74\n    5\n    3\n  \n  \n    18.0\n    313.0\n    11.5\n    62\n    5\n    4\n  \n  \n    \n    \n    14.3\n    56\n    5\n    5\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n        \n\n\n\n\nCustomizing Text\nWe can style text with by using the style.text() function. This gives us many customization possibilities for any text we target. For example, the Solar_R column below has green, bolded text in a custom font.\n\ngt_air.tab_style(\n    style=style.text(color=\"green\", font=\"Times New Roman\", weight=\"bold\"),\n    locations=loc.body(columns=\"Solar_R\")\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  Ozone\n  Solar_R\n  Wind\n  Temp\n  Month\n  Day\n\n\n\n  \n    41.0\n    190.0\n    7.4\n    67\n    5\n    1\n  \n  \n    36.0\n    118.0\n    8.0\n    72\n    5\n    2\n  \n  \n    12.0\n    149.0\n    12.6\n    74\n    5\n    3\n  \n  \n    18.0\n    313.0\n    11.5\n    62\n    5\n    4\n  \n  \n    \n    \n    14.3\n    56\n    5\n    5",

    "text": "Column-based Styles\nIn addition to setting styles to specific values (e.g., a \"yellow\" background fill), you can also use parameter values from table columns to specify styles. The way to do this is to use the from_column() helper function to access those values.\n\ndf = pl.DataFrame({\"x\": [1, 2], \"background\": [\"lightyellow\", \"lightblue\"]})\n\n(\n    GT(df)\n    .tab_style(\n        style=style.fill(color=from_column(column=\"background\")),\n        locations=loc.body(columns=\"x\")\n    )\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  x\n  background\n\n\n\n  \n    1\n    lightyellow\n  \n  \n    2\n    lightblue\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n        \n\n\nNotice that in the code above, we used values from the background column to specify the fill color for each styled row.\nIn the next few sections, we’ll first show how this combines nicely with the cols_hide() method, then, we’ll demonstrate how to use Polars expressions to do everything much more simply.\n\nCombining Styling with cols_hide()\nOne common approach is to specify a style from a column, and then hide that column in the final output. For example, we can add a background column to our airquality data:\n\ncolor_map = {\n    True: \"lightyellow\",\n    False: \"lightblue\"\n}\n\nwith_color = air_head.assign(\n    background=(air_head[\"Temp\"] &gt; 70).replace(color_map)\n)\n\nwith_color\n\n\n\n\n  \n    \n      \n      Ozone\n      Solar_R\n      Wind\n      Temp\n      Month\n      Day\n      background\n    \n  \n  \n    \n      0\n      41.0\n      190.0\n      7.4\n      67\n      5\n      1\n      lightblue\n    \n    \n      1\n      36.0\n      118.0\n      8.0\n      72\n      5\n      2\n      lightyellow\n    \n    \n      2\n      12.0\n      149.0\n      12.6\n      74\n      5\n      3\n      lightyellow\n    \n    \n      3\n      18.0\n      313.0\n      11.5\n      62\n      5\n      4\n      lightblue\n    \n    \n      4\n      NaN\n      NaN\n      14.3\n      56\n      5\n      5\n      lightblue\n    \n  \n\n\n\n\nNotice that the dataset now has a background column set to either \"lightyellow\" or \"lightblue\", depending on whether Temp is above 70.\nWe can then use this background column to set the fill color of certain body cells, and then hide the background column since we don’t need that in our finalized display table:\n\n(\n    GT(with_color)\n    .tab_style(\n        style=style.fill(color=from_column(column=\"background\")),\n        locations=loc.body(columns=\"Temp\")\n    )\n    .cols_hide(columns=\"background\")\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  Ozone\n  Solar_R\n  Wind\n  Temp\n  Month\n  Day\n\n\n\n  \n    41.0\n    190.0\n    7.4\n    67\n    5\n    1\n  \n  \n    36.0\n    118.0\n    8.0\n    72\n    5\n    2\n  \n  \n    12.0\n    149.0\n    12.6\n    74\n    5\n    3\n  \n  \n    18.0\n    313.0\n    11.5\n    62\n    5\n    4\n  \n  \n    \n    \n    14.3\n    56\n    5\n    5\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n        \n\n\nNote the two methods used above:\n\ntab_style(): uses from_column() to set the color using the values of the background column.\ncols_hide(): prevents the background column from being displayed in the output.\n\n\n\nUsing Polars expressions\nStyles can also be specified using Polars expressions. For example, the code below uses the Temp column to set color to \"lightyellow\" or \"lightblue\".\n\n# A Polars expression defines color based on `Temp`\ntemp_color = (\n    pl.when(pl.col(\"Temp\") &gt; 70)\n    .then(pl.lit(\"lightyellow\"))\n    .otherwise(pl.lit(\"lightblue\"))\n)\n\ngt_pl_air.tab_style(\n    style=style.fill(color=temp_color),\n    locations=loc.body(\"Temp\")\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  Ozone\n  Solar_R\n  Wind\n  Temp\n  Month\n  Day\n\n\n\n  \n    41.0\n    190.0\n    7.4\n    67\n    5\n    1\n  \n  \n    36.0\n    118.0\n    8.0\n    72\n    5\n    2\n  \n  \n    12.0\n    149.0\n    12.6\n    74\n    5\n    3\n  \n  \n    18.0\n    313.0\n    11.5\n    62\n    5\n    4\n  \n  \n    None\n    None\n    14.3\n    56\n    5\n    5\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n        \n\n\n\n\nUsing functions\nYou can also use a function, that takes the DataFrame and returns a Series with a style value for each row.\nThis is shown below on a pandas DataFrame.\n\ndef map_color(df):\n    return (df[\"Temp\"] &gt; 70).map(\n        {True: \"lightyellow\", False: \"lightblue\"}\n    )\n\ngt_air.tab_style(\n    style=style.fill(\n        color=map_color),\n    locations=loc.body(\"Temp\")\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  Ozone\n  Solar_R\n  Wind\n  Temp\n  Month\n  Day\n\n\n\n  \n    41.0\n    190.0\n    7.4\n    67\n    5\n    1\n  \n  \n    36.0\n    118.0\n    8.0\n    72\n    5\n    2\n  \n  \n    12.0\n    149.0\n    12.6\n    74\n    5\n    3\n  \n  \n    18.0\n    313.0\n    11.5\n    62\n    5\n    4\n  \n  \n    \n    \n    14.3\n    56\n    5\n    5",

    "text": "You sometimes come across heat maps in data visualization, and they’re used to represent data values with color gradients. This technique is great for identifying patterns, trends, outliers, and missing data when there’s lots of data. Tables can have this sort of treatment as well! Typically, formatted numeric values are shown along with some color treatment coinciding with the underlying data values.\nWe can make this possible in Great Tables by using the data_color() method. Let’s start with a simple example, using a Polars DataFrame with three columns of values. We can introduce that data to GT and use data_color() without any arguments.\nfrom great_tables import GT\nimport polars as pl\n\nsimple_df = pl.DataFrame(\n    {\n        \"integer\": [1, 2, 3, 4, 5],\n        \"float\": [2.3, 1.3, 5.1, None, 4.4],\n        \"category\": [\"one\", \"two\", \"three\", \"one\", \"three\"],\n    }\n)\n\nGT(simple_df).data_color()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  integer\n  float\n  category\n\n\n\n  \n    1\n    2.3\n    one\n  \n  \n    2\n    1.3\n    two\n  \n  \n    3\n    5.1\n    three\n  \n  \n    4\n    None\n    one\n  \n  \n    5\n    4.4\n    three\nThis works but doesn’t look all too appealing. However, we can take note of a few things straight away. The first thing is that data_color() doesn’t format the values but rather it applies color fill values to the cells. The second thing is that you don’t have to intervene and modify the text color so that there’s enough contrast, Great Tables will do that for you (this behavior can be deactivated with the autocolor_text= argument though).",

Categorical values behave similarly, they take on ordinal values based on their first appearance (from top to bottom) and those values are used to generate the background colors.",

That can be changed with the domain= argument, which expects a list of two values (a lower and an upper value). Let’s use the range [0, 10] on the first two columns, integer and float, and not the third (since a numerical domain is incompatible with string-based values). Here’s the table code for that:\n\n(\n    GT(simple_df)\n    .data_color(\n        columns=[\"integer\", \"float\"],\n        palette=[\"blue\", \"red\"],\n        domain=[0, 10],\n        na_color=\"white\"\n    )\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  integer\n  float\n  category\n\n\n\n  \n    1\n    2.3\n    one\n  \n  \n    2\n    1.3\n    two\n  \n  \n    3\n    5.1\n    three\n  \n  \n    4\n    None\n    one\n  \n  \n    5\n    4.4\n    three\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n        \n\n\nNice! We can clearly see that the color ramp in the first column (integer) only proceeds from blue (value: 1) to purple (value: 5) and there isn’t a reddish color in sight (would need a value close to 10).",

    "text": "Bringing it all together\nFor a more advanced treatment of data colorization in the table, let’s take the sza dataset (available in the great_tables.data submodule) and vigorously reshape it with Polars so that solar zenith angles are arranged as rows by month, and the half-hourly clock times are the columns (from early morning to solar noon).\nOnce the pivot()ing is done, we can introduce that that table to the GT class, placing the names of the months in the table stub. We will use data_color() with a domain that runs from 90 to 0 (here, 90° is sunrise, and 0° is represents the sun angle that’s directly overhead). There are months where the sun rises later in the morning, before the sunrise times we’ll see missing values in the dataset, and na_color=\"white\" will handle those cases.

We found that Polars lazy expression system opened up convenient ways to conditionally format tables for presentation. However, excited as we were, we were harboring a shameful secret: Great Tables enabled Polars as an optional dependency, but had a hard dependency on the alternative DataFrame library Pandas.\nWe’re happy to share that Great Tables v0.5.0 makes Pandas an optional dependency. Using Pandas DataFrames as inputs is still fully supported. The optional dependency simply allows users of one DataFrame library to not have to install the other.\nIn this post, I’ll cover three important pieces:\nThis may seem over the top, but many DataFrame implementations exist in the Python world. Enabling folks to BYODF (Bring Your Own DataFrame) is a tricky, rewarding challenge!"

    "text": "The state of Great Tables dependencies\nCurrently, Great Tables has two “sizes” of libraries it depends on:\n\nSmall: utility libraries for things like datetime localization.\nBig: a lingering dependency on numpy in a few places (like nanoplots).\n\nFor small utilities, we depend on Babel, which makes it easier to say things like, “format this number as if I’m in Germany”.\nFor big dependencies, numpy should be fairly straightforward to remove (see this issue). We also still rely on Pandas for datasets in great_tables.data, but we will remove it soon (see this issue).\nRemoving dependencies like numpy and Pandas helps people who are in restricted computing environments, want a more lightweight install, or who are stuck depending on a much earlier version of a package. It also helps us keep a clean separation of concerns. Without clear boundaries, it’s too tempting to reach for things like pd.isna() in a pinch, or smear library specific versions of missingness across our code (e.g. pd.NA, np.nan, polars.NullType)."

    "section": "The challenge of removing hard dependencies",
    "text": "The challenge of removing hard dependencies\nRemoving hard dependencies on DataFrame libraries is worthwhile, but requires special handling for all DataFrame specific actions. To illustrate consider the Great Tables output below, which is produced from a Pandas DataFrame:\n\nimport pandas as pd\nimport polars as pl\nfrom great_tables import GT\n\ndf_pandas = pd.DataFrame({\"x\": [\"a\", \"b\"], \"y\": [1.01, 2.0]})\ndf_polars = pl.from_pandas(df_pandas)\n\nGT(df_pandas)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  x\n  y\n\n\n\n  \n    a\n    1.01\n  \n  \n    b\n    2.0\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n        \n\n\nProducing this table includes two actions on the DataFrame:\n\nGet column names: these are used for column labels (and other things).\nGet column types: these are used for alignment (e.g. numeric column is right aligned).\n\nWhile these actions may seem simple, they require different methods for different DataFrame implementations. In this post, we’ll focus specifically on the challenge of getting column names.\n\nGetting column names\nThe code below shows the different methods required to get column names as a list from Pandas and Polars.\n\ndf_pandas.columns.tolist()  # pandas\ndf_polars.columns           # polars\n\n['x', 'y']\n\n\nNotice that the two lines of code aren’t too different—Pandas just requires an extra .tolist() piece. We could create a special function, that returns a list of names, depending on the type of the input DataFrame.\n\ndef get_column_names(data) -&gt; list[str]:\n\n    # pandas specific ----\n    if isinstance(data, pd.DataFrame):\n        return data.columns.tolist()\n\n    # polars specific ----\n    elif isinstance(data, pl.DataFrame):\n        return data.columns\n\n    raise TypeError(f\"Unsupported type {type(data)}\")\n\nThe function works great, in that we can call it on either DataFrame, but it lacks two things. The first is dependency inversion, since it requires importing both Pandas and Polars (creating a hard dependency). The second is separation of concerns, since Pandas and Polars code is mixed together. In this case adding more DataFrame implementations would create a hot stew of logic."

    "text": "How we made Pandas optional\nWe were able to make Pandas optional in a sane manner through two moves:\n\ndatabackend: perform isinstance checks without importing anything.\nsingledispatch: split out functions like get_column_names() into DataFrame specific versions.\n\n\nInverting dependency with databackend\nInverting dependency on DataFrame libraries means that we check whether something is a specific type of DataFrame, without using imports. This is done through the package databackend, which we copied into Great Tables.\nIt works by creating placeholder classes, which stand in for the DataFrames they’re detecting:\n\nfrom great_tables._databackend import AbstractBackend\n\n\nclass PdDataFrame(AbstractBackend):\n    _backends = [(\"pandas\", \"DataFrame\")]\n\n\nclass PlDataFrame(AbstractBackend):\n    _backends = [(\"polars\", \"DataFrame\")]\n\n\nif isinstance(df_pandas, PdDataFrame):\n    print(\"I'm a pandas DataFrame!!!\")\n\nI'm a pandas DataFrame!!!\n\n\nNote that the PdDataFrame above is able to detect a Pandas DataFrame without importing Pandas, by taking advantage of a bit of logic called a counterfactual:\n\nassumption: if df_pandas is a Pandas DataFrame, then Pandas has been imported.\ncounterfactual: if Pandas has not been imported, then df_pandas is not a Pandas DataFrame.\n\nThis lets it quickly rule out a potential Pandas object by checking whether Pandas has been imported. Since this can be done by looking inside sys.modules, no imports are required. For more on this approach, see the databackend README.\n\n\nSeparating concerns with singledispatch\nWhile databackend removes dependencies, the use of singledispatch from the built-in functools module separates out the logic for handling Polars DataFrames from the logic for Pandas DataFrames. This makes it easier to think one DataFrame at a time, and also gets us better type hinting.\nHere’s a basic example, showing the get_column_names() function re-written using singledispatch:\n\nfrom functools import singledispatch\n\n\n# define the generic function ----\n#\n@singledispatch\ndef get_column_names(data) -&gt; list[str]:\n    raise TypeError(f\"Unsupported type {type(data)}\")\n\n\n# register a pandas implementation on it ----\n#\n@get_column_names.register\ndef _(data: PdDataFrame):\n    return data.columns.tolist()\n\n\n# register a polars implementation on it ----\n#\n@get_column_names.register\ndef _(data: PlDataFrame):\n    return data.columns\n\nNote three important pieces:\n\nThe initial @singledispatch decorates def get_column_names(...). This creates a special “generic function”, which can define DataFrame specific implementations.\n@get_column_names.register implements the Pandas DataFrame.\nThe use of PdDataFrame is what signifies “run this for Pandas DataFrames”.\n\nWith the get_column_names implementations defined, we can call it like a normal function:\n\nget_column_names(df_pandas)  # pandas version\nget_column_names(df_polars)  # polars version\n\n['x', 'y']\n\n\nFor more on the benefits of singledispatch in data tooling, see the blog post Single Dispatch for Data Science Tools. For the nitty gritty on our DataFrame processing, see the Great Tables _tbl_data.py submodule."

They are interactive, allowing for more information to be shown on hovering (or through touch when that interaction is available). Nanoplots try to show individual data points with reasonably good visibility (space is limited, this is going in a table after all!) and the plot representations change depending on the data fed into them.\nWe can generate nanoplots via the fmt_nanoplot() method. Let’s make two nanoplots of the two different available plot types: \"line\" and \"bar\":\n\nrandom_numbers_df = pl.DataFrame(\n    {\n        \"i\": range(1, 5),\n        \"lines\": [\n            \"20 23 6 7 37 23 21 4 7 16\",\n            \"2.3 6.8 9.2 2.42 3.5 12.1 5.3 3.6 7.2 3.74\",\n            \"-12 -5 6 3.7 0 8 -7.4\",\n            \"2 0 15 7 8 10 1 24 17 13 6\",\n        ],\n    }\n).with_columns(bars=pl.col(\"lines\"))\n\n(\n    GT(random_numbers_df, rowname_col=\"i\")\n    .fmt_nanoplot(columns=\"lines\", plot_type=\"line\")\n    .fmt_nanoplot(columns=\"bars\", plot_type=\"bar\")\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  lines\n  bars\n\n\n\n  \n    1\n    3742023673723214716\n    3702023673723214716\n  \n  \n    2\n    12.12.302.306.809.202.423.5012.15.303.607.203.74\n    12.102.306.809.202.423.5012.15.303.607.203.74\n  \n  \n    3\n    8.00−12.0−12.0−5.006.003.7008.00−7.40\n    8.00−12.0−12.0−5.006.003.7008.00−7.40\n  \n  \n    4\n    2402015781012417136\n    2402015781012417136\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n        \n\n\nAs can be seen, the method accepts bundles of values per cell that are formatted as strings (with spaces between each of the values). You can also use Polars list columns as acceptable input.\n\n\nAdding reference lines and highlighted areas\nIt’s possible to add in a reference line and a reference area to individual plots. These may be useful to highlight a particular statistic (e.g., median or minimum value) or a bounded region of interest (e.g., the area between the first and third quartiles). Here is an example of how to use these options via the reference_line= and reference_area= arguments:\n\n(\n    GT(random_numbers_df, rowname_col=\"i\")\n    .fmt_nanoplot(\n        columns=\"lines\",\n        reference_line=\"mean\",\n        reference_area=[\"min\", \"q1\"]\n    )\n    .fmt_nanoplot(\n        columns=\"bars\",\n        plot_type=\"bar\",\n        reference_line=\"max\",\n        reference_area=[\"max\", \"median\"])\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  lines\n  bars\n\n\n\n  \n    1\n    16.43742023673723214716\n    37.03742023673723214716\n  \n  \n    2\n    5.6212.12.302.306.809.202.423.5012.15.303.607.203.74\n    12.112.12.302.306.809.202.423.5012.15.303.607.203.74\n  \n  \n    3\n    −0.968.00−12.0−12.0−5.006.003.7008.00−7.40\n    8.008.00−12.0−12.0−5.006.003.7008.00−7.40\n  \n  \n    4\n    9.362402015781012417136\n    24.02402015781012417136\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n        \n\n\nHaving a reference line and/or area can be valuable in different situations. We make it easy by allowing you to mix-and-match numeric values and a set of keywords (these are: \"mean\", \"median\", \"min\", \"max\", \"q1\", \"q3\", \"first\", or \"last\").\n\n\nSimple bars\nWe can also have single-value bar plots and line plots. These will run in the horizontal direction and such plots are meant for easy value comparisons (which works great in tables). To make this work, give fmt_nanoplot() a column of numeric values. The following example shows how fmt_nanoplot() can be used to create single-value bar and line plots.\n\nsingle_vals_df = pl.DataFrame(\n    {\n        \"i\": range(1, 6),\n        \"bars\": [4.1, 1.3, -5.3, 0, 8.2],\n        \"lines\": [12.44, 6.34, 5.2, -8.2, 9.23]\n    }\n)\n\n(\n    GT(single_vals_df, rowname_col=\"i\")\n    .fmt_nanoplot(columns=\"bars\", plot_type=\"bar\")\n    .fmt_nanoplot(columns=\"lines\", plot_type=\"line\")\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  bars\n  lines\n\n\n\n  \n    1\n    4.10\n    12.4\n  \n  \n    2\n    1.30\n    6.34\n  \n  \n    3\n    −5.30\n    5.20\n  \n  \n    4\n    0\n    −8.20\n  \n  \n    5\n    8.20\n    9.23\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n        \n\n\nNotice that there is some light interactivity available here as well! When hovering over a plotted bar or line the data value will appear.\n\n\nCustomizing with nanoplot_options()\nWe provide a lot of options for customizing your nanoplots. With the nanoplot_options() helper function, it’s possible to change the look and feel for a set of nanoplots. The options= argument of fmt_nanoplot() is where you’d need to invoke that helper function. Some possibilities for customization include determining which nanoplot elements are present, changing the sizes and colors of different elements, and a whole lot more! Here’s an example where both line- and bar-based nanoplots retain their basic compositional elements, but their appearance is quite different.\n\nfrom great_tables import nanoplot_options\n\n(\n    GT(random_numbers_df)\n    .fmt_nanoplot(\n        columns=\"lines\",\n        options=nanoplot_options(\n            data_point_radius=8,\n            data_point_stroke_color=\"black\",\n            data_point_stroke_width=3,\n            data_point_fill_color=\"white\",\n            data_line_type=\"straight\",\n            data_line_stroke_color=\"green\",\n            data_line_stroke_width=5,\n            data_area_fill_color=\"green\",\n            show_data_area=False,\n        ),\n    )\n    .fmt_nanoplot(\n        columns=\"bars\",\n        plot_type=\"bar\",\n        options=nanoplot_options(\n            data_bar_stroke_color=\"brown\",\n            data_bar_fill_color=\"yellow\",\n            data_bar_negative_stroke_color=\"black\",\n            data_bar_negative_fill_color=\"blue\",\n        ),\n    )\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  i\n  lines\n  bars\n\n\n\n  \n    1\n    3742023673723214716\n    3702023673723214716\n  \n  \n    2\n    12.12.302.306.809.202.423.5012.15.303.607.203.74\n    12.102.306.809.202.423.5012.15.303.607.203.74\n  \n  \n    3\n    8.00−12.0−12.0−5.006.003.7008.00−7.40\n    8.00−12.0−12.0−5.006.003.7008.00−7.40\n  \n  \n    4\n    2402015781012417136\n    2402015781012417136\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n        \n\n\nWe want you to have a lot of creative control for how these tiny plots are displayed. So, when you need it, nanoplot_options() is there for you!\n\n\nWrapping up\nWe’re always excited to offer new and exciting features that make summary tables fun and useful. The new nanoplots functionality is something we will continue to iterate on since there is definitely room for plotting innovation in tables for display. And there’s a lot more to nanoplots than these examples can show. For much more information on this, check out the Get Started guide on nanoplots.

One neat feature included in the release was a DataFrame.style property—which returns a Great Tables object, so you can add things like titles, column labels, and highlighting for reporting.\nWhen talking about the Polars integration, people are often surprised to hear it happened when Great Tables was only 8 months old. Moreover, the whole process of how open source maintainers chat and discuss teaming up can feel shrouded in mystery.\nIn this post, I want to take some time to discuss how folks in the Polars and Great Tables communities got to DataFrame.style. There are three big pieces:"

    "section": "How we got there",
    "text": "How we got there\n\nFirst contact: Polars discord\nRoughly a year ago, Rich Iannone and I (Michael Chow) started working together on Great Tables—a Python library for creating display tables. Initially, Great Tables only supported Pandas, but this made a few things difficult. For example, selecting columns and applying conditional styles took a surprising amount of code.\nAs an experiment, we added support for Polars, and wrote a post called Great Tables: The Polars DataFrame Styler of Your Dreams.\nCurious in what folks thought, we dropped it in the Polars discord, and got some Great Feedback:\n\nBut Ritchie Vink, the creator of Polars, knew we were harboring a shameful Pandas dependency secret:\n\nIt’s true, we had baked Pandas in as a dependency. We were just kids back then when starting Great Tables. We didn’t realize that the world was moving to DataFrame agnostic support 😓.\nBut the more we used Polars with Great Tables, the happier we were. So we made some architectural tweaks to make Great Tables BYODF (Bring Your Own DataFrame). With these changes, Polars users could install and use Great Tables without pulling in an unnecessary dependency on another DataFrame library (Pandas).\nThese interactions were critical early on for co-designing Great Tables with Polars in mind. But the real magic for us was when Polars users started opening PRs on Great Tables, to make sure we got things right. Chief among them, Jerry Wu!\n\n\nJerry Wu: power contributor\nLuckily, members of the Polars community, like Jerry Wu (jrycw), showed up to make sure we wired up to Polars correctly, and to weigh in on how Polars should be used.\nFor example, Jerry’s first PR was ensuring we handled a Polars deprecation correctly.\n\nI really can’t overstate how much we appreciate his help, and how critical it has been in ensuring we get the details right.\nIn addition to his PRs, Jerry has done really Great Work sharing about table display. The most interesting example of this to me is that he discovered that Polars, Great Tables, and FastHTML work well together.\n\nRich and I had no idea that was possible, and the FastHTML folks ended up adapting his example into an entry on their gallery. Jerry is constantly teaching us about what Great Tables can do.\n\n\nGrowing up: making the case for .style\nWith so much joy coming out of the Polars integration, and support from folks in the Polars community, we started to wonder: how could Great Tables make Polars a first-class citizen?\nThis ultimately boiled down to asking: what would it take for the polars.DataFrame.style property to return a Great Tables object?\nAfter some discussion on discord, the big pieces folks needed were some sense that Great Tables used a reasonable approach to table styling, carried few dependencies, and was engineered such that it could be returned from a DataFrame.style property. Ultimately, the next few months were spent getting Great Tables up to snuff, and the Polars PR merged."

    "text": "Making .style work\nThe PR to implement .style in Polars went super quick, from advice on discord April to merged by June. A huge force behind the PR was Marco Gorelli, who encouraged us through the process!\nIn this section I’ll look at how we addressed the 3 big requirements behind making a strong case for .DataFrame.style returning a Great Tables object:\n\nDesign Credibility: It’s clear Great Tables is reasonably thought out.\nWorking with Polars selectors: It integrates well with pieces like Polars selectors.\nTechnical: Great Tables can be returned from a DataFrame.style property.\n\n\nDesign credibility\nOur biggest hurdle was that the Great Tables library was less than a year old. However, this youthful appearance is a bit misleading, because Great Tables builds on decades of table design and tooling. For example, Rich’s version of Great Tables in R, called gt, has been around since 2019 (see his rstudio::conf() talk).\nMy favorite aspect of gt is that the community ran table contests every year. The contests don’t even require the use of gt or Great Tables, just a zest for the art of table styling. The 2024 Table Contest had around 60 submissions, and is something we often draw on for inspiration.\nFor more on the long history of table design, see The Design Philosophy of Great Tables, or this Fred Hutch better tables workshop.\n\n\nWorking with Polars selectors\nOne important task was sorting out how we use Polars selectors, to ensure they didn’t break down the road.\nFor example, Great Tables allows Polars selectors to set styles on specific columns data. However, one challenge we ran into was figuring out what Polars considers an expression versus a selector. Essentially, selectors choose columns, but expressions represent operations on the data itself.\nThe code below shows cases where the .exclude() results in expressions or selectors.\n\nimport polars as pl\nimport polars.selectors as cs\n\n# selector: all columns except \"a\"\ncs.exclude(\"a\")\n\n# expression: same columns as above ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯\ncs.all().exclude(\"a\")\n\nAfter discussing with Polars folks in this Polars issue, we landed on 4 rules for selectors:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nrule\ndescription\nexample\n\n\n\n\ncs functions\ntop-level cs selection functions -&gt; selector\ncs.starts_with(\"a\")\n\n\ninfix selectors\ninfix operators over all selectors -&gt; selector\ncs.starts_with(\"a\") - cs.by_name(\"abc\")\n\n\ninfix expressions\ninfix operators over any non-selectors -&gt; expression\ncs.starts_with(\"a\") - \"abc\"\n\n\nmethod expressions\nmethod calls off selectors -&gt; expression\ncs.all().exclude(\"a\")\n\n\n\nClarifying this was critical in Great Tables, because in some place we only accept selectors, so we needed to be able to articulate to users how to produce them.\n\n\nTechnical wiring work\nThe last hurdle was tweaking the great_tables.GT class to fit the flow of DataFrame.style. For example, here is what creating a GT() object looked like before and after .style:\n\nBefore: GT(my_data, id=\"my-table\")\nAfter: my_data.style.with_id(\"my-table\")\n\nNotice that before, the GT(id=...) argument could set the html id for a table. However, DataFrame.style is a property that can’t take arguments, so we needed methods like with_id() to set these kinds of options.\nHere’s a full code example, in case you want to see it in action.\n\nimport polars as pl\nfrom great_tables import GT\nfrom great_tables import exibble\n\n# create a GT object ----\nGT(exibble, id=\"my-table\")\n\n# create GT object via .style property ----\npl.DataFrame(exibble).style\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  num\n  char\n  fctr\n  date\n  time\n  datetime\n  currency\n  row\n  group\n\n\n\n  \n    0.1111\n    apricot\n    one\n    2015-01-15\n    13:35\n    2018-01-01 02:22\n    49.95\n    row_1\n    grp_a\n  \n  \n    2.222\n    banana\n    two\n    2015-02-15\n    14:40\n    2018-02-02 14:33\n    17.95\n    row_2\n    grp_a\n  \n  \n    33.33\n    coconut\n    three\n    2015-03-15\n    15:45\n    2018-03-03 03:44\n    1.39\n    row_3\n    grp_a\n  \n  \n    444.4\n    durian\n    four\n    2015-04-15\n    16:50\n    2018-04-04 15:55\n    65100.0\n    row_4\n    grp_a\n  \n  \n    5550.0\n    None\n    five\n    2015-05-15\n    17:55\n    2018-05-05 04:00\n    1325.81\n    row_5\n    grp_b\n  \n  \n    None\n    fig\n    six\n    2015-06-15\n    None\n    2018-06-06 16:11\n    13.255\n    row_6\n    grp_b\n  \n  \n    777000.0\n    grapefruit\n    seven\n    None\n    19:10\n    2018-07-07 05:22\n    None\n    row_7\n    grp_b\n  \n  \n    8880000.0\n    honeydew\n    eight\n    2015-08-15\n    20:20\n    None\n    0.44\n    row_8\n    grp_b\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n        \n\n\nThe DataFrame.style property is special, in that you don’t pass any parameters to it. The motivation for this in Polars is that it matches the Pandas pandas.DataFrame.style approach, so provides a familiar interface for users coming from that package. It also matches the DataFrame.plot flow of both packages.\nAs it turns out, allowing every options settable in the GT() constructor to be set somewhere else was not something anticipated in the design of Great Tables. But after some light architectural wrestling, we introduced .tab_stub(), .with_id(), and .with_locale() to capture arguments you might pass to GT()."

We ended up putting a ring on it, and ensuring Great Tables design, dependencies, and architecture worked well enough to justify returning via polars.DataFrame.style. (Though this is still marked unstable in Polars!)\nWe’re excited to look at different use cases for Great Tables (and table styling in general) over the next year!"

Great Tables provides a large selection of methods and they let you refine the table display. They were designed so that you can easily create a really presentable and beautiful table visualization.\nFor this next table, we’ll incorporate a Stub component and this provides a place for the row labels. Groupings of rows will be generated through categorical values in a particular column (we just have to cite the column name for that to work). We’ll add a table title and subtitle with tab_header(). The numerical values will be formatted with the fmt_integer() and fmt_currency() methods. Column labels will be enhanced via cols_label() and a source note will be included through use of the tab_source_note() method. Here is the table code, followed by the table itself.\n\nfrom great_tables import GT, md, html\nfrom great_tables.data import gtcars\n\ngtcars_mini = gtcars[[\"mfr\", \"model\", \"year\", \"hp\", \"trq\", \"msrp\"]].tail(10)\n\n(\n    GT(gtcars_mini, rowname_col=\"model\", groupname_col=\"mfr\")\n    .tab_spanner(label=md(\"*Performance*\"), columns=[\"hp\", \"trq\"])\n    .tab_header(\n        title=html(\"Data listing from &lt;strong&gt;gtcars&lt;/strong&gt;\"),\n        subtitle=html(\"A &lt;span style='font-size:12px;'&gt;small selection&lt;/span&gt; of great cars.\"),\n    )\n    .cols_label(year=\"Year Produced\", hp=\"HP\", trq=\"Torque\", msrp=\"Price (USD)\")\n    .fmt_integer(columns=[\"year\", \"hp\", \"trq\"], use_seps=False)\n    .fmt_currency(columns=\"msrp\")\n    .tab_source_note(source_note=\"Source: the gtcars dataset within the Great Tables package.\")\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n    Data listing from gtcars\n  \n  \n    A small selection of great cars.\n  \n\n  \n  Year Produced\n  \n    Performance\n  \n  Price (USD)\n\n\n  HP\n  Torque\n\n\n\n  \n    Mercedes-Benz\n  \n  \n    AMG GT\n    2016\n    503\n    479\n    $129,900.00\n  \n  \n    SL-Class\n    2016\n    329\n    354\n    $85,050.00\n  \n  \n    Tesla\n  \n  \n    Model S\n    2017\n    259\n    243\n    $74,500.00\n  \n  \n    Porsche\n  \n  \n    718 Boxster\n    2017\n    300\n    280\n    $56,000.00\n  \n  \n    718 Cayman\n    2017\n    300\n    280\n    $53,900.00\n  \n  \n    911\n    2016\n    350\n    287\n    $84,300.00\n  \n  \n    Panamera\n    2016\n    310\n    295\n    $78,100.00\n  \n  \n    McLaren\n  \n  \n    570\n    2016\n    570\n    443\n    $184,900.00\n  \n  \n    Rolls-Royce\n  \n  \n    Dawn\n    2016\n    563\n    575\n    $335,000.00\n  \n  \n    Wraith\n    2016\n    624\n    590\n    $304,350.00\n  \n\n  \n  \n  \n    Source: the gtcars dataset within the Great Tables package.\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n        \n\n\nWith the six different methods applied, the table looks highly presentable! The rendering you’re seeing here has been done through Quarto (this entire site has been generated with quartodoc). If you haven’t yet tried out Quarto, we highly recommend it!\nFor this next example we’ll use the airquality dataset (also included in the package; it’s inside the data submodule). With this table, two spanners will be added with the tab_spanner() method. This method is meant to be easy to use, you only need to provide the text for the spanner label and the columns associated with the spanner. We also make it easy to move columns around. You can use cols_move_to_start() (example of that below) and there are also the cols_move_to_end() and cols_move() methods.\n\nfrom great_tables.data import airquality\n\nairquality_mini = airquality.head(10).assign(Year=1973)\n\n(\n    GT(airquality_mini)\n    .tab_header(\n        title=\"New York Air Quality Measurements\",\n        subtitle=\"Daily measurements in New York City (May 1-10, 1973)\",\n    )\n    .cols_label(\n        Ozone=html(\"Ozone,&lt;br&gt;ppbV\"),\n        Solar_R=html(\"Solar R.,&lt;br&gt;cal/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;\"),\n        Wind=html(\"Wind,&lt;br&gt;mph\"),\n        Temp=html(\"Temp,&lt;br&gt;&deg;F\"),\n    )\n    .tab_spanner(label=\"Date\", columns=[\"Year\", \"Month\", \"Day\"])\n    .tab_spanner(label=\"Measurement\", columns=[\"Ozone\", \"Solar.R\", \"Wind\", \"Temp\"])\n    .cols_move_to_start(columns=[\"Year\", \"Month\", \"Day\"])\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n    New York Air Quality Measurements\n  \n  \n    Daily measurements in New York City (May 1-10, 1973)\n  \n\n  \n    Date\n  \n  \n    Measurement\n  \n  Solar R.,cal/m2\n\n\n  Year\n  Month\n  Day\n  Ozone,ppbV\n  Wind,mph\n  Temp,°F\n\n\n\n  \n    1973\n    5\n    1\n    41.0\n    7.4\n    67\n    190.0\n  \n  \n    1973\n    5\n    2\n    36.0\n    8.0\n    72\n    118.0\n  \n  \n    1973\n    5\n    3\n    12.0\n    12.6\n    74\n    149.0\n  \n  \n    1973\n    5\n    4\n    18.0\n    11.5\n    62\n    313.0\n  \n  \n    1973\n    5\n    5\n    \n    14.3\n    56\n    \n  \n  \n    1973\n    5\n    6\n    28.0\n    14.9\n    66\n    \n  \n  \n    1973\n    5\n    7\n    23.0\n    8.6\n    65\n    299.0\n  \n  \n    1973\n    5\n    8\n    19.0\n    13.8\n    59\n    99.0\n  \n  \n    1973\n    5\n    9\n    8.0\n    20.1\n    61\n    19.0\n  \n  \n    1973\n    5\n    10\n    \n    8.6\n    69\n    194.0\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n        \n\n\nThat table looks really good, and the nice thing about all these methods is that they can be used in virtually any order."

For example, most of the formatting methods have a locale= argument. We want as many users as possible to be able to format numbers, dates, and times in ways that are familiar to them and are adapted to their own regional specifications.

Below, we’ll present four examples corresponding to the cases outlined in the documentation:\n\nCase 1: Local file paths.\nCase 2: Full HTTP/HTTPS URLs.\nCase 3: Image names with the path= argument.\nCase 4: Image names using both the path= and file_pattern= arguments.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTipFinding the Right Case for Your Needs\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCase 1 and Case 2 work best for data sourced directly from a database.\nCase 3 is ideal for users dealing with image names relative to a base directory or URL (e.g., /path/to/images).\nCase 4 is tailored for users working with patterned image names (e.g., metro_{}.svg).\n\n\n\n\n\nPreparations\nFor this demonstration, we’ll use the first five rows of the built-in metro dataset, specifically the name and lines columns.\nTo ensure a smooth walkthrough, we’ll manipulate the data (a Python dictionary) directly. However, in real-world applications, such operations are more likely performed at the DataFrame level to leverage the benefits of vectorized operations.\n\n\nShow the Code\nimport pandas as pd\nfrom great_tables import GT, vals, html\nfrom importlib_resources import files\n\npd.set_option('display.max_colwidth', 150)\n\ndata = {\n    \"name\": [\n        \"Argentine\",\n        \"Bastille\",\n        \"Bérault\",\n        \"Champs-Élysées—Clemenceau\",\n        \"Charles de Gaulle—Étoile\",\n    ],\n    \"lines\": [\"1\", \"1, 5, 8\", \"1\", \"1, 13\", \"1, 2, 6\"],\n}\n\nprint(\"\"\"\\\ndata = {\n    \"name\": [\n        \"Argentine\",\n        \"Bastille\",\n        \"Bérault\",\n        \"Champs-Élysées—Clemenceau\",\n        \"Charles de Gaulle—Étoile\",\n    ],\n    \"lines\": [\"1\", \"1, 5, 8\", \"1\", \"1, 13\", \"1, 2, 6\"],\n}\\\n\"\"\")\n\n\ndata = {\n    \"name\": [\n        \"Argentine\",\n        \"Bastille\",\n        \"Bérault\",\n        \"Champs-Élysées—Clemenceau\",\n        \"Charles de Gaulle—Étoile\",\n    ],\n    \"lines\": [\"1\", \"1, 5, 8\", \"1\", \"1, 13\", \"1, 2, 6\"],\n}\n\n\nAttentive readers may have noticed that the values for the key lines are lists of strings, each containing one or more numbers separated by commas. GT.fmt_image() is specifically designed to handle such cases, allowing users to render multiple images in a single row.\n\n\nCase 1: Local File Paths\nCase 1 demonstrates how to simulate a column containing strings representing local file paths. We’ll use images stored in the data/metro_images directory of Great Tables:\n\n1img_local_paths = files(\"great_tables\") / \"data/metro_images\"\n\n\n1\n\nThese image files follow a patterned naming convention, such as metro_1.svg, metro_2.svg, and so on.\n\n\n\n\nBelow is a Pandas DataFrame called metro_mini1, where the case1 column contains local file paths that we want to render as images.\n\n\nShow the Code\nmetro_mini1 = pd.DataFrame(\n    {\n        **data,\n        \"case1\": [\n            \", \".join(\n                str((img_local_paths / f\"metro_{item}\").with_suffix(\".svg\"))\n                for item in row.split(\", \")\n            )\n            for row in data[\"lines\"]\n        ],\n    }\n)\nmetro_mini1\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n    \n      \n      name\n      lines\n      case1\n    \n  \n  \n    \n      0\n      Argentine\n      1\n      /opt/hostedtoolcache/Python/3.10.19/x64/lib/python3.10/site-packages/great_tables/data/metro_images/metro_1.svg\n    \n    \n      1\n      Bastille\n      1, 5, 8\n      /opt/hostedtoolcache/Python/3.10.19/x64/lib/python3.10/site-packages/great_tables/data/metro_images/metro_1.svg, /opt/hostedtoolcache/Python/3.10....\n    \n    \n      2\n      Bérault\n      1\n      /opt/hostedtoolcache/Python/3.10.19/x64/lib/python3.10/site-packages/great_tables/data/metro_images/metro_1.svg\n    \n    \n      3\n      Champs-Élysées—Clemenceau\n      1, 13\n      /opt/hostedtoolcache/Python/3.10.19/x64/lib/python3.10/site-packages/great_tables/data/metro_images/metro_1.svg, /opt/hostedtoolcache/Python/3.10....\n    \n    \n      4\n      Charles de Gaulle—Étoile\n      1, 2, 6\n      /opt/hostedtoolcache/Python/3.10.19/x64/lib/python3.10/site-packages/great_tables/data/metro_images/metro_1.svg, /opt/hostedtoolcache/Python/3.10....\n    \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTipUse the pathlib Module to Construct Paths\n\n\n\n\n\nLocal file paths can vary depending on the operating system, which makes it easy to accidentally construct invalid paths. A good practice to mitigate this is to use Python’s built-in pathlib module to construct paths first and then convert them to strings. In this example, img_local_paths is actually an instance of pathlib.Path.\n\nfrom pathlib import Path\n\nisinstance(img_local_paths, Path)  # True\n\n\n\n\nThe case1 column is quite lengthy due to the inclusion of img_local_paths. In Case 3, we’ll share a useful trick to avoid repeating the directory name each time—stay tuned!\nFor now, let’s use GT.fmt_image() to render images by passing \"case1\" as the first argument:\n\nGT(metro_mini1).fmt_image(\"case1\").cols_align(align=\"right\", columns=\"case1\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  name\n  lines\n  case1\n\n\n\n  \n    Argentine\n    1\n    \n  \n  \n    Bastille\n    1, 5, 8\n      \n  \n  \n    Bérault\n    1\n    \n  \n  \n    Champs-Élysées—Clemenceau\n    1, 13\n     \n  \n  \n    Charles de Gaulle—Étoile\n    1, 2, 6\n      \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n        \n\n\n\n\nCase 2: Full HTTP/HTTPS URLs\nCase 2 demonstrates how to simulate a column containing strings representing HTTP/HTTPS URLs. We’ll use the same images as in Case 1, but this time, retrieve them from the Great Tables GitHub repository:\n\nimg_url_paths = \"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/posit-dev/great-tables/refs/heads/main/great_tables/data/metro_images\"\n\nBelow is a Pandas DataFrame called metro_mini2, where the case2 column contains full HTTP/HTTPS URLs that we aim to render as images.\n\n\nShow the Code\nmetro_mini2 = pd.DataFrame(\n    {\n        **data,\n        \"case2\": [\n            \", \".join(f\"{img_url_paths}/metro_{item}.svg\" for item in row.split(\", \"))\n            for row in data[\"lines\"]\n        ],\n    }\n)\nmetro_mini2\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n    \n      \n      name\n      lines\n      case2\n    \n  \n  \n    \n      0\n      Argentine\n      1\n      https://raw.githubusercontent.com/posit-dev/great-tables/refs/heads/main/great_tables/data/metro_images/metro_1.svg\n    \n    \n      1\n      Bastille\n      1, 5, 8\n      https://raw.githubusercontent.com/posit-dev/great-tables/refs/heads/main/great_tables/data/metro_images/metro_1.svg, https://raw.githubusercontent...\n    \n    \n      2\n      Bérault\n      1\n      https://raw.githubusercontent.com/posit-dev/great-tables/refs/heads/main/great_tables/data/metro_images/metro_1.svg\n    \n    \n      3\n      Champs-Élysées—Clemenceau\n      1, 13\n      https://raw.githubusercontent.com/posit-dev/great-tables/refs/heads/main/great_tables/data/metro_images/metro_1.svg, https://raw.githubusercontent...\n    \n    \n      4\n      Charles de Gaulle—Étoile\n      1, 2, 6\n      https://raw.githubusercontent.com/posit-dev/great-tables/refs/heads/main/great_tables/data/metro_images/metro_1.svg, https://raw.githubusercontent...\n    \n  \n\n\n\n\nThe lengthy case2 column issue can also be addressed using the trick shared in Case 3.\nSimilarly, we can use GT.fmt_image() to render images by passing \"case2\" as the first argument:\n\nGT(metro_mini2).fmt_image(\"case2\").cols_align(align=\"right\", columns=\"case2\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  name\n  lines\n  case2\n\n\n\n  \n    Argentine\n    1\n    \n  \n  \n    Bastille\n    1, 5, 8\n      \n  \n  \n    Bérault\n    1\n    \n  \n  \n    Champs-Élysées—Clemenceau\n    1, 13\n     \n  \n  \n    Charles de Gaulle—Étoile\n    1, 2, 6\n      \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n        \n\n\n\n\nCase 3: Image Names with the path= Argument\nCase 3 demonstrates how to use the path= argument to specify images relative to a base directory or URL. This approach eliminates much of the repetition in file names, offering a solution to the issues in Case 1 and Case 2.\nBelow is a Pandas DataFrame called metro_mini3, where the case3 column contains file names that we aim to render as images.\n\n\nShow the Code\nmetro_mini3 = pd.DataFrame(\n    {\n        **data,\n        \"case3\": [\n            \", \".join(f\"metro_{item}.svg\" for item in row.split(\", \")) for row in data[\"lines\"]\n        ],\n    }\n)\nmetro_mini3\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n    \n      \n      name\n      lines\n      case3\n    \n  \n  \n    \n      0\n      Argentine\n      1\n      metro_1.svg\n    \n    \n      1\n      Bastille\n      1, 5, 8\n      metro_1.svg, metro_5.svg, metro_8.svg\n    \n    \n      2\n      Bérault\n      1\n      metro_1.svg\n    \n    \n      3\n      Champs-Élysées—Clemenceau\n      1, 13\n      metro_1.svg, metro_13.svg\n    \n    \n      4\n      Charles de Gaulle—Étoile\n      1, 2, 6\n      metro_1.svg, metro_2.svg, metro_6.svg\n    \n  \n\n\n\n\nNow we can use GT.fmt_image() to render the images by passing \"case3\" as the first argument and specifying either img_local_paths or img_url_paths as the path= argument:\n\n# equivalent to `Case 1`\n(\n    GT(metro_mini3)\n    .fmt_image(\"case3\", path=img_local_paths)\n    .cols_align(align=\"right\", columns=\"case3\")\n)\n\n# equivalent to `Case 2`\n(\n    GT(metro_mini3)\n    .fmt_image(\"case3\", path=img_url_paths)\n    .cols_align(align=\"right\", columns=\"case3\")\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  name\n  lines\n  case3\n\n\n\n  \n    Argentine\n    1\n    \n  \n  \n    Bastille\n    1, 5, 8\n      \n  \n  \n    Bérault\n    1\n    \n  \n  \n    Champs-Élysées—Clemenceau\n    1, 13\n     \n  \n  \n    Charles de Gaulle—Étoile\n    1, 2, 6\n      \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n        \n\n\nAfter exploring Case 1 and Case 2, you’ll likely appreciate the functionality of the path= argument. However, manually constructing file names can still be a bit tedious. If your file names follow a consistent pattern, the file_pattern= argument can simplify the process. Let’s see how this works in Case 4 below.\n\n\nCase 4: Image Names Using Both the path= and file_pattern= Arguments\nCase 4 demonstrates how to use path= and file_pattern= to specify images with names following a common pattern. For example, you could use file_pattern=\"metro_{}.svg\" to reference images like metro_1.svg, metro_2.svg, and so on.\nBelow is a Pandas DataFrame called metro_mini4, where the case4 column contains a copy of data[\"lines\"], which we aim to render as images.\n\n\nShow the Code\nmetro_mini4 = pd.DataFrame({**data, \"case4\": data[\"lines\"]})\nmetro_mini4\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n    \n      \n      name\n      lines\n      case4\n    \n  \n  \n    \n      0\n      Argentine\n      1\n      1\n    \n    \n      1\n      Bastille\n      1, 5, 8\n      1, 5, 8\n    \n    \n      2\n      Bérault\n      1\n      1\n    \n    \n      3\n      Champs-Élysées—Clemenceau\n      1, 13\n      1, 13\n    \n    \n      4\n      Charles de Gaulle—Étoile\n      1, 2, 6\n      1, 2, 6\n    \n  \n\n\n\n\nFirst, define a string pattern to illustrate the file naming convention, using {} to indicate the variable portion:\n\nfile_pattern = \"metro_{}.svg\"\n\nNext, pass \"case4\" as the first argument, along with img_local_paths or img_url_paths as the path= argument, and file_pattern as the file_pattern= argument. This allows GT.fmt_image() to render the images:\n\n# equivalent to `Case 1`\n(\n    GT(metro_mini4)\n    .fmt_image(\"case4\", path=img_local_paths, file_pattern=file_pattern)\n    .cols_align(align=\"right\", columns=\"case4\")\n)\n\n# equivalent to `Case 2`\n(\n    GT(metro_mini4)\n    .fmt_image(\"case4\", path=img_url_paths, file_pattern=file_pattern)\n    .cols_align(align=\"right\", columns=\"case4\")\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  name\n  lines\n  case4\n\n\n\n  \n    Argentine\n    1\n    \n  \n  \n    Bastille\n    1, 5, 8\n      \n  \n  \n    Bérault\n    1\n    \n  \n  \n    Champs-Élysées—Clemenceau\n    1, 13\n     \n  \n  \n    Charles de Gaulle—Étoile\n    1, 2, 6\n      \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarningUsing file_pattern= Independently\n\n\n\n\n\nThe file_pattern= argument is typically used in conjunction with the path= argument, but this is not a strict rule. If your local file paths or HTTP/HTTPS URLs follow a pattern, you can use file_pattern= alone without path=. This allows you to include the shared portion of the file paths or URLs directly in file_pattern, as shown below:\n\nfile_pattern = str(img_local_paths / \"metro_{}.svg\")\n(\n    GT(metro_mini4)\n    .fmt_image(\"case4\", file_pattern=file_pattern)\n    .cols_align(align=\"right\", columns=\"case4\")\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  name\n  lines\n  case4\n\n\n\n  \n    Argentine\n    1\n    \n  \n  \n    Bastille\n    1, 5, 8\n      \n  \n  \n    Bérault\n    1\n    \n  \n  \n    Champs-Élysées—Clemenceau\n    1, 13\n     \n  \n  \n    Charles de Gaulle—Étoile\n    1, 2, 6\n      \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n        \n\n\n\n\n\nCase 4 is undoubtedly one of the most powerful features of Great Tables. While mastering it may take some practice, we hope this example helps you render images effortlessly and effectively."

In such cases, you can turn to the versatile vals.fmt_image().\nvals.fmt_image() is a hidden gem in Great Tables. Its usage is similar to GT.fmt_image(), but instead of working directly with DataFrame columns, it lets you pass a string or a list of strings as the first argument, returning a list of strings, each representing an image. You can then wrap these strings with html(), allowing Great Tables to render the images anywhere in the table.\n\nPreparations\nWe will create a Pandas DataFrame named metro_mini using the data dictionary.

    "text": "Analyzing data with polars is a no-brainer in python. It provides an intuitive, expressive interface to data. When it comes to reports, it’s trivial to plug polars into plotting libraries like seaborn, plotly, and plotnine.\nHowever, there are fewer options for styling tables for presentation. You could convert from polars to pandas, and use the built-in pandas DataFrame styler, but this has one major limitation: you can’t use polars expressions.\nAs it turns out, polars expressions make styling tables very straightforward. The same polars code that you would use to select or filter combines with Great Tables to highlight, circle, or bolden text.\nIn this post, I’ll show how Great Tables uses polars expressions to make delightful tables, like the one below.\nCode\nimport polars as pl\nimport polars.selectors as cs\n\nfrom great_tables import GT, md, html, style, loc\nfrom great_tables.data import airquality\n\nairquality_mini = airquality.head(10).assign(Year = 1973)\npl_airquality = pl.DataFrame(airquality_mini).select(\n    \"Year\", \"Month\", \"Day\", \"Ozone\", \"Solar_R\", \"Wind\", \"Temp\"\n)\ngt_air = GT(pl_airquality)\n\n(\n    gt_air\n\n    # Table header ----\n    .tab_header(\n        title = \"New York Air Quality Measurements\",\n        subtitle = \"Daily measurements in New York City (May 1-10, 1973)\"\n    )\n\n    # Table column spanners ----\n    .tab_spanner(\n        label = \"Time\",\n        columns = [\"Year\", \"Month\", \"Day\"]\n    )\n    .tab_spanner(\n        label = \"Measurement\",\n        columns = [\"Ozone\", \"Solar_R\", \"Wind\", \"Temp\"]\n    )\n    .cols_label(\n        Ozone = html(\"Ozone,&lt;br&gt;ppbV\"),\n        Solar_R = html(\"Solar R.,&lt;br&gt;cal/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;\"),\n        Wind = html(\"Wind,&lt;br&gt;mph\"),\n        Temp = html(\"Temp,&lt;br&gt;&deg;F\")\n    )\n\n    # Table styles ----\n    .tab_style(\n        style.fill(\"lightyellow\"),\n        loc.body(\n            columns = cs.all(),\n            rows = pl.col(\"Wind\") == pl.col(\"Wind\").max()\n        )\n    )\n    .tab_style(\n        style.text(weight = \"bold\"),\n        loc.body(\"Wind\", pl.col(\"Wind\") == pl.col(\"Wind\").max())\n    )\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n    New York Air Quality Measurements\n  \n  \n    Daily measurements in New York City (May 1-10, 1973)\n  \n\n  \n    Time\n  \n  \n    Measurement\n  \n\n\n  Year\n  Month\n  Day\n  Ozone,ppbV\n  Solar R.,cal/m2\n  Wind,mph\n  Temp,°F\n\n\n\n  \n    1973\n    5\n    1\n    41.0\n    190.0\n    7.4\n    67\n  \n  \n    1973\n    5\n    2\n    36.0\n    118.0\n    8.0\n    72\n  \n  \n    1973\n    5\n    3\n    12.0\n    149.0\n    12.6\n    74\n  \n  \n    1973\n    5\n    4\n    18.0\n    313.0\n    11.5\n    62\n  \n  \n    1973\n    5\n    5\n    None\n    None\n    14.3\n    56\n  \n  \n    1973\n    5\n    6\n    28.0\n    None\n    14.9\n    66\n  \n  \n    1973\n    5\n    7\n    23.0\n    299.0\n    8.6\n    65\n  \n  \n    1973\n    5\n    8\n    19.0\n    99.0\n    13.8\n    59\n  \n  \n    1973\n    5\n    9\n    8.0\n    19.0\n    20.1\n    61\n  \n  \n    1973\n    5\n    10\n    None\n    194.0\n    8.6\n    69"

Working with polars has been an absolute dream, and we’re excited to explore different ways it and Great Tables make for easy table styling!"

In this post, I’ll look at three approaches I tried: adding plots with plotnine, svg.py, or adding HTML directly. In the first two cases, the plots are SVGs, while the latter entails a collection of composed HTML div elements.\nHere are the pieces I’ll cover:\nIn the end, it’s often simplest to use svg.py, since you can create basic charts with minimal overhead. Building elements with HTML has even less overhead, but it is also slightly less user-friendly. At the other end of the spectrum, as your charts become more complex, using existing packages like the more exhaustive plotnine is a good alternative.\nAnimal\n  Legs\n  Plot\n\n\n\n  \n    Ostrich\n    2\n    2\n  \n  \n    Spider\n    8\n    8\n  \n  \n    Lion\n    4\n    4\nHere is the final result:\nCode\nimport polars as pl\nfrom great_tables import GT\nfrom svg import SVG, Rect, Line\n\ndf = pl.DataFrame({\"Animal\": [\"Ostrich\", \"Spider\", \"Lion\"], \"Legs\": [2, 8, 4], \"Plot\": [2, 8, 4]})\n\nwidth = 50\nheight = 30\nmax_legs_value = df[\"Legs\"].max()\n\n\ndef create_plot_svg_py(val: int) -&gt; str:\n    canvas = SVG(\n        width=width,\n        height=height,\n        elements=[\n            Rect(\n                x=0,\n                y=height / 4,\n                width=width * (val / max_legs_value),\n                height=height / 2,\n                fill=\"blue\",\n            ),\n            Line(x1=0, x2=0, y1=0, y2=height, stroke=\"black\"),\n        ],\n    )\n\n    html = f\"&lt;div&gt;{canvas}&lt;/div&gt;\"\n    return html\n\n\nGT(df).fmt(fns=create_plot_svg_py, columns=[\"Plot\"])\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  Animal\n  Legs\n  Plot\n\n\n\n  \n    Ostrich\n    2\n    \n  \n  \n    Spider\n    8\n    \n  \n  \n    Lion\n    4"

In writing graphical plotting functions for gt-extras, I’ve personally turned towards an HTML-only approach that I’ve felt comfortable with in other settings. With that said, I do believe converting table values to graphic output is a task best done with a little bit of help (whether it be svg-py or another plotting package will depend on how detailed your plots are).\nThe choice ultimately depends on your specific needs: simplicity and directness, versus abstraction and power. By understanding the trade-offs, you will be able to tailor your approach to the needs of your project."

    "section": "",
    "text": "We did something in Great Tables (0.13.0) that’ll make your tables that much more customizable: super fine-grained ways of setting styles throughout the table. Before you were largely constrained to styling through the following strategies:\n\nuse a limited set of styles (e.g., background color, font weight, etc.) to different table locations like the stub, the column labels, etc., through tab_options()\nuse tab_style() with a larger set of styling options for the table body cells (specified by loc.body())\n\nIn v0.13.0, we can target much more than just the table body! Here is the expanded set of loc.*() methods along with the locations that they can target.\n\nThis augmentation of the loc module to include all locations in the table means that there won’t be a spot in the table to which you can’t add styling. This is terrific because it gives you free rein to fully customize the look of your table.\nLet’s make a table and see how this new feature could be used.\n\nStarting things off with a big GT table\nThe table we’ll make uses the nuclides dataset (available in the great_tables.data module).

And the following checklist will serve as a rough plan for how we will style the table:\n\nuse loc.body() to emphasize isotope half-life values\nemploy loc.stub() to draw attention to isotope names (and also point out the ‘STABLE’ rows)\nuse style.css() for creating custom CSS styles (e.g., to indent row labels for stable isotopes)\nwork with composite locations and style the whole header and footer quite simply\nset the default table body fill with tab_options()\n\nReally this’ll be tab_style() like you’ve never seen it before, so let’s get on with it.\n\n\nStyling the body\nFirst, we’ll use loc.body() to emphasize half life values in two ways:\n\nMake the values in the atomic_mass and half_life use a monospace font.\nfill the background of isotopes with STABLE half lives to be PaleTurquoise.\n\n\ngt_tbl = (\n    gt_tbl\n    .tab_style(\n        style=style.text(font=google_font(name=\"IBM Plex Mono\")),\n        locations=loc.body(columns=[\"atomic_mass\", \"half_life\"])\n    )\n    .tab_style(\n        style=[style.text(color=\"Navy\"), style.fill(color=\"PaleTurquoise\")],\n        locations=loc.body(columns=\"half_life\", rows=pl.col(\"half_life\").is_not_null())\n    )\n)\n\ngt_tbl\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n    Isotopes of Carbon\n  \n  \n    There are two stable isotopes of carbon and twelve that are unstable.\n  \n\n  Isotope\n  Atomic Mass\n  Half Life, s\n  Isospin\n  \n    Decay Mode\n  \n\n\n  1\n  2\n  3\n\n\n\n  \n    C-8\n    8.0376\n    3.51 × 10−21\n    2\n    2P\n    —\n    —\n  \n  \n    C-9\n    9.0310\n    1.26 × 10−1\n    3/2\n    EC+B+\n    B+P\n    B+A\n  \n  \n    C-10\n    10.0169\n    1.93 × 101\n    1\n    EC+B+\n    —\n    —\n  \n  \n    C-11\n    11.0114\n    1.22 × 103\n    1/2\n    EC+B+\n    —\n    —\n  \n  \n    C-12\n    12.0000\n    STABLE\n    0\n    —\n    —\n    —\n  \n  \n    C-13\n    13.0034\n    STABLE\n    1/2\n    —\n    —\n    —\n  \n  \n    C-14\n    14.0032\n    1.80 × 1011\n    1\n    B-\n    —\n    —\n  \n  \n    C-15\n    15.0106\n    2.45\n    3/2\n    B-\n    —\n    —\n  \n  \n    C-16\n    16.0147\n    7.47 × 10−1\n    2\n    B-\n    B-N\n    —\n  \n  \n    C-17\n    17.0226\n    1.93 × 10−1\n    None\n    B-\n    B-N\n    —\n  \n  \n    C-18\n    18.0268\n    9.20 × 10−2\n    3\n    B-\n    B-N\n    —\n  \n  \n    C-19\n    19.0348\n    4.63 × 10−2\n    None\n    B-\n    B-N\n    B-2N\n  \n  \n    C-20\n    20.0403\n    1.63 × 10−2\n    None\n    B-\n    B-N\n    B-2N\n  \n  \n    C-22\n    22.0576\n    6.10 × 10−3\n    None\n    B-\n    B-N\n    B-2N\n  \n\n  \n  \n  \n    Data obtained from the nuclides dataset.\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n        \n\n\nNote these important pieces in the code:\n\nsetting monospace font: we used google_font() (added in the previous release) to apply the monospaced font IBM Plex Mono.\nfilling unstable half lives to turquoise: because the half life cells with the value STABLE are actually missing in the underlying data, and filled in using GT.sub_missing(), we used the polars expression pl.col(\"half_life\").is_not_null() to target everything that isn’t STABLE.\n\nThis is mainly a reminder that Polars expressions are quite something. And targeting cells in the body with loc.body(rows=...) can be powerful by extension.\n\n\nDon’t forget the stub!\nWe mustn’t forget the stub. It’s a totally separate location, being off to the side and having the important responsibility of holding the row labels. Here, we are going to do two things:\n\nChange the fill color (to ‘Linen’) and make the text bold for the entire stub\nHighlight the rows where we have stable isotopes (the extent is both for the stub and the body cells)\n\n\ngt_tbl = (\n    gt_tbl\n    .tab_style(\n        style=[style.fill(color=\"Linen\"), style.text(weight=\"bold\")],\n        locations=loc.stub()\n    )\n    .tab_style(\n        style=style.fill(color=\"LightCyan\"),\n        locations=[\n            loc.body(rows=pl.col(\"half_life\").is_null()),\n            loc.stub(rows=pl.col(\"half_life\").is_null())\n        ]\n    )\n )\n\ngt_tbl\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n    Isotopes of Carbon\n  \n  \n    There are two stable isotopes of carbon and twelve that are unstable.\n  \n\n  Isotope\n  Atomic Mass\n  Half Life, s\n  Isospin\n  \n    Decay Mode\n  \n\n\n  1\n  2\n  3\n\n\n\n  \n    C-8\n    8.0376\n    3.51 × 10−21\n    2\n    2P\n    —\n    —\n  \n  \n    C-9\n    9.0310\n    1.26 × 10−1\n    3/2\n    EC+B+\n    B+P\n    B+A\n  \n  \n    C-10\n    10.0169\n    1.93 × 101\n    1\n    EC+B+\n    —\n    —\n  \n  \n    C-11\n    11.0114\n    1.22 × 103\n    1/2\n    EC+B+\n    —\n    —\n  \n  \n    C-12\n    12.0000\n    STABLE\n    0\n    —\n    —\n    —\n  \n  \n    C-13\n    13.0034\n    STABLE\n    1/2\n    —\n    —\n    —\n  \n  \n    C-14\n    14.0032\n    1.80 × 1011\n    1\n    B-\n    —\n    —\n  \n  \n    C-15\n    15.0106\n    2.45\n    3/2\n    B-\n    —\n    —\n  \n  \n    C-16\n    16.0147\n    7.47 × 10−1\n    2\n    B-\n    B-N\n    —\n  \n  \n    C-17\n    17.0226\n    1.93 × 10−1\n    None\n    B-\n    B-N\n    —\n  \n  \n    C-18\n    18.0268\n    9.20 × 10−2\n    3\n    B-\n    B-N\n    —\n  \n  \n    C-19\n    19.0348\n    4.63 × 10−2\n    None\n    B-\n    B-N\n    B-2N\n  \n  \n    C-20\n    20.0403\n    1.63 × 10−2\n    None\n    B-\n    B-N\n    B-2N\n  \n  \n    C-22\n    22.0576\n    6.10 × 10−3\n    None\n    B-\n    B-N\n    B-2N\n  \n\n  \n  \n  \n    Data obtained from the nuclides dataset.\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n        \n\n\nFor task #1, a simple .tab_style(..., locations=loc.stub()) targeted the entire stub.\nTask #2 is more interesting. Like loc.body(), loc.stub() has a rows= argument that can target specific rows with Polars expressions. We used the same Polars expression as in the previous section to target those rows that belong to the stable isotopes.\nWe’ve dressed up the stub so that it is that much more prominent. And that linen-colored stub goes so well with the light-cyan rows, representative of carbon-12 and carbon-13!\n\n\nUsing custom style rules with the new style.css()\nAside from decking out the loc module with all manner of location methods, we’ve added a little something to the style module: style.css()! What’s it for? It lets you supply style declarations to its single rule= argument.\nAs an example, I might want to indent some text in one or more table cells. You can’t really do that with the style.text() method since it doesn’t have an indent= argument. So, in Great Tables 0.13.0 you can manually indent the row label text for the ‘STABLE’ rows using a CSS style rule:\n\ngt_tbl = (\n    gt_tbl\n    .tab_style(\n        style=style.css(rule=\"text-indent: 4px;\"),\n        locations=loc.stub(rows=pl.col(\"half_life\").is_null())\n    )\n)\n\ngt_tbl\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n    Isotopes of Carbon\n  \n  \n    There are two stable isotopes of carbon and twelve that are unstable.\n  \n\n  Isotope\n  Atomic Mass\n  Half Life, s\n  Isospin\n  \n    Decay Mode\n  \n\n\n  1\n  2\n  3\n\n\n\n  \n    C-8\n    8.0376\n    3.51 × 10−21\n    2\n    2P\n    —\n    —\n  \n  \n    C-9\n    9.0310\n    1.26 × 10−1\n    3/2\n    EC+B+\n    B+P\n    B+A\n  \n  \n    C-10\n    10.0169\n    1.93 × 101\n    1\n    EC+B+\n    —\n    —\n  \n  \n    C-11\n    11.0114\n    1.22 × 103\n    1/2\n    EC+B+\n    —\n    —\n  \n  \n    C-12\n    12.0000\n    STABLE\n    0\n    —\n    —\n    —\n  \n  \n    C-13\n    13.0034\n    STABLE\n    1/2\n    —\n    —\n    —\n  \n  \n    C-14\n    14.0032\n    1.80 × 1011\n    1\n    B-\n    —\n    —\n  \n  \n    C-15\n    15.0106\n    2.45\n    3/2\n    B-\n    —\n    —\n  \n  \n    C-16\n    16.0147\n    7.47 × 10−1\n    2\n    B-\n    B-N\n    —\n  \n  \n    C-17\n    17.0226\n    1.93 × 10−1\n    None\n    B-\n    B-N\n    —\n  \n  \n    C-18\n    18.0268\n    9.20 × 10−2\n    3\n    B-\n    B-N\n    —\n  \n  \n    C-19\n    19.0348\n    4.63 × 10−2\n    None\n    B-\n    B-N\n    B-2N\n  \n  \n    C-20\n    20.0403\n    1.63 × 10−2\n    None\n    B-\n    B-N\n    B-2N\n  \n  \n    C-22\n    22.0576\n    6.10 × 10−3\n    None\n    B-\n    B-N\n    B-2N\n  \n\n  \n  \n  \n    Data obtained from the nuclides dataset.\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n        \n\n\nWe targeted the cells in the stub that corresponded to the stable isotopes (carbon-12 and -13) with a Polars expression (same one as in the previous code cell) and now we have a 4px indentation of the ‘C-12’ and ‘C-13’ text! This new bonus functionality really allows almost any type of styling possible, provided you have those CSS skillz.\n\n\nThe combined location helpers: loc.column_header() and loc.footer()\nLook, I know we brought up the expression fine-grained before—right in the first paragraph—but sometimes you need just the opposite. There are lots of little locations in a GT table and some make for logical groupings. To that end, we have the concept of combined location helpers.\nLet’s set a grey background fill on the stubhead, column header, and footer:\n\ngt_tbl = (\n    gt_tbl\n    .tab_style(\n        style=[style.text(v_align=\"middle\"), style.fill(color=\"#EEEEEE\")],\n        locations=[loc.stubhead(), loc.column_header(), loc.footer()]\n    )\n)\n\ngt_tbl\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n    Isotopes of Carbon\n  \n  \n    There are two stable isotopes of carbon and twelve that are unstable.\n  \n\n  Isotope\n  Atomic Mass\n  Half Life, s\n  Isospin\n  \n    Decay Mode\n  \n\n\n  1\n  2\n  3\n\n\n\n  \n    C-8\n    8.0376\n    3.51 × 10−21\n    2\n    2P\n    —\n    —\n  \n  \n    C-9\n    9.0310\n    1.26 × 10−1\n    3/2\n    EC+B+\n    B+P\n    B+A\n  \n  \n    C-10\n    10.0169\n    1.93 × 101\n    1\n    EC+B+\n    —\n    —\n  \n  \n    C-11\n    11.0114\n    1.22 × 103\n    1/2\n    EC+B+\n    —\n    —\n  \n  \n    C-12\n    12.0000\n    STABLE\n    0\n    —\n    —\n    —\n  \n  \n    C-13\n    13.0034\n    STABLE\n    1/2\n    —\n    —\n    —\n  \n  \n    C-14\n    14.0032\n    1.80 × 1011\n    1\n    B-\n    —\n    —\n  \n  \n    C-15\n    15.0106\n    2.45\n    3/2\n    B-\n    —\n    —\n  \n  \n    C-16\n    16.0147\n    7.47 × 10−1\n    2\n    B-\n    B-N\n    —\n  \n  \n    C-17\n    17.0226\n    1.93 × 10−1\n    None\n    B-\n    B-N\n    —\n  \n  \n    C-18\n    18.0268\n    9.20 × 10−2\n    3\n    B-\n    B-N\n    —\n  \n  \n    C-19\n    19.0348\n    4.63 × 10−2\n    None\n    B-\n    B-N\n    B-2N\n  \n  \n    C-20\n    20.0403\n    1.63 × 10−2\n    None\n    B-\n    B-N\n    B-2N\n  \n  \n    C-22\n    22.0576\n    6.10 × 10−3\n    None\n    B-\n    B-N\n    B-2N\n  \n\n  \n  \n  \n    Data obtained from the nuclides dataset.\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n        \n\n\nThe loc.column_header() location always targets both loc.column_labels() and loc.spanner_labels().\nA good strategy for your tables would be to style with combined location helpers first and then drill into the specific cells of those super locations with more fine-grained styles in a later tab_style() call.\n\n\nStyling the title and the subtitle\nAlthough it really doesn’t appear to have separate locations, the table header (produced by way of tab_header()) can have two of them: the title and the subtitle (the latter is optional). These can be targeted via loc.title() and loc.subtitle(). Let’s focus in on the title location and set an aliceblue background fill on the title, along with some font and border adjustments.\n\ngt_tbl = (\n    gt_tbl\n    .tab_style(\n        style=[\n            style.text(size=\"24px\"),\n            style.fill(color=\"aliceblue\"),\n            style.borders(sides=\"bottom\", color=\"#BFDFF6\", weight=\"2px\")\n        ],\n        locations=loc.title()\n    )\n)\n\ngt_tbl\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n    Isotopes of Carbon\n  \n  \n    There are two stable isotopes of carbon and twelve that are unstable.\n  \n\n  Isotope\n  Atomic Mass\n  Half Life, s\n  Isospin\n  \n    Decay Mode\n  \n\n\n  1\n  2\n  3\n\n\n\n  \n    C-8\n    8.0376\n    3.51 × 10−21\n    2\n    2P\n    —\n    —\n  \n  \n    C-9\n    9.0310\n    1.26 × 10−1\n    3/2\n    EC+B+\n    B+P\n    B+A\n  \n  \n    C-10\n    10.0169\n    1.93 × 101\n    1\n    EC+B+\n    —\n    —\n  \n  \n    C-11\n    11.0114\n    1.22 × 103\n    1/2\n    EC+B+\n    —\n    —\n  \n  \n    C-12\n    12.0000\n    STABLE\n    0\n    —\n    —\n    —\n  \n  \n    C-13\n    13.0034\n    STABLE\n    1/2\n    —\n    —\n    —\n  \n  \n    C-14\n    14.0032\n    1.80 × 1011\n    1\n    B-\n    —\n    —\n  \n  \n    C-15\n    15.0106\n    2.45\n    3/2\n    B-\n    —\n    —\n  \n  \n    C-16\n    16.0147\n    7.47 × 10−1\n    2\n    B-\n    B-N\n    —\n  \n  \n    C-17\n    17.0226\n    1.93 × 10−1\n    None\n    B-\n    B-N\n    —\n  \n  \n    C-18\n    18.0268\n    9.20 × 10−2\n    3\n    B-\n    B-N\n    —\n  \n  \n    C-19\n    19.0348\n    4.63 × 10−2\n    None\n    B-\n    B-N\n    B-2N\n  \n  \n    C-20\n    20.0403\n    1.63 × 10−2\n    None\n    B-\n    B-N\n    B-2N\n  \n  \n    C-22\n    22.0576\n    6.10 × 10−3\n    None\n    B-\n    B-N\n    B-2N\n  \n\n  \n  \n  \n    Data obtained from the nuclides dataset.\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n        \n\n\nLooks good. Notice that the title location is separate from the subtitle one, the background fill reveals the extent of its area.\nA subtitle is an optional part of the header. We do have one in our table example, so let’s style that as well. The style.css() method will be used to give the subtitle text some additional top and bottom padding, and, we’ll put in a fancy background involving a linear gradient.\n\ngt_tbl = (\n    gt_tbl\n    .tab_style(\n        style=style.css(rule=\"padding-top: 5px;\"\n            \"padding-bottom: 5px;\"\n            \"background-image: linear-gradient(120deg, #d4fc79 0%, #96f6a1 100%);\"\n        ),\n        locations=loc.subtitle()\n    )\n)\n\ngt_tbl\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n    Isotopes of Carbon\n  \n  \n    There are two stable isotopes of carbon and twelve that are unstable.\n  \n\n  Isotope\n  Atomic Mass\n  Half Life, s\n  Isospin\n  \n    Decay Mode\n  \n\n\n  1\n  2\n  3\n\n\n\n  \n    C-8\n    8.0376\n    3.51 × 10−21\n    2\n    2P\n    —\n    —\n  \n  \n    C-9\n    9.0310\n    1.26 × 10−1\n    3/2\n    EC+B+\n    B+P\n    B+A\n  \n  \n    C-10\n    10.0169\n    1.93 × 101\n    1\n    EC+B+\n    —\n    —\n  \n  \n    C-11\n    11.0114\n    1.22 × 103\n    1/2\n    EC+B+\n    —\n    —\n  \n  \n    C-12\n    12.0000\n    STABLE\n    0\n    —\n    —\n    —\n  \n  \n    C-13\n    13.0034\n    STABLE\n    1/2\n    —\n    —\n    —\n  \n  \n    C-14\n    14.0032\n    1.80 × 1011\n    1\n    B-\n    —\n    —\n  \n  \n    C-15\n    15.0106\n    2.45\n    3/2\n    B-\n    —\n    —\n  \n  \n    C-16\n    16.0147\n    7.47 × 10−1\n    2\n    B-\n    B-N\n    —\n  \n  \n    C-17\n    17.0226\n    1.93 × 10−1\n    None\n    B-\n    B-N\n    —\n  \n  \n    C-18\n    18.0268\n    9.20 × 10−2\n    3\n    B-\n    B-N\n    —\n  \n  \n    C-19\n    19.0348\n    4.63 × 10−2\n    None\n    B-\n    B-N\n    B-2N\n  \n  \n    C-20\n    20.0403\n    1.63 × 10−2\n    None\n    B-\n    B-N\n    B-2N\n  \n  \n    C-22\n    22.0576\n    6.10 × 10−3\n    None\n    B-\n    B-N\n    B-2N\n  \n\n  \n  \n  \n    Data obtained from the nuclides dataset.\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n        \n\n\nNone of what was done above could be done prior to v0.13.0. The style.css() method makes this all possible.\nThe combined location helper for the title and the subtitle locations is loc.header(). As mentioned before, it can be used as a shorthand for locations=[loc.title(), loc_subtitle()] and it’s useful here where we want to change the font for the title and subtitle text.\n\ngt_tbl = (\n    gt_tbl\n    .tab_style(\n        style=style.text(font=google_font(\"IBM Plex Serif\")),\n        locations=loc.header()\n    )\n)\n\ngt_tbl\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n    Isotopes of Carbon\n  \n  \n    There are two stable isotopes of carbon and twelve that are unstable.\n  \n\n  Isotope\n  Atomic Mass\n  Half Life, s\n  Isospin\n  \n    Decay Mode\n  \n\n\n  1\n  2\n  3\n\n\n\n  \n    C-8\n    8.0376\n    3.51 × 10−21\n    2\n    2P\n    —\n    —\n  \n  \n    C-9\n    9.0310\n    1.26 × 10−1\n    3/2\n    EC+B+\n    B+P\n    B+A\n  \n  \n    C-10\n    10.0169\n    1.93 × 101\n    1\n    EC+B+\n    —\n    —\n  \n  \n    C-11\n    11.0114\n    1.22 × 103\n    1/2\n    EC+B+\n    —\n    —\n  \n  \n    C-12\n    12.0000\n    STABLE\n    0\n    —\n    —\n    —\n  \n  \n    C-13\n    13.0034\n    STABLE\n    1/2\n    —\n    —\n    —\n  \n  \n    C-14\n    14.0032\n    1.80 × 1011\n    1\n    B-\n    —\n    —\n  \n  \n    C-15\n    15.0106\n    2.45\n    3/2\n    B-\n    —\n    —\n  \n  \n    C-16\n    16.0147\n    7.47 × 10−1\n    2\n    B-\n    B-N\n    —\n  \n  \n    C-17\n    17.0226\n    1.93 × 10−1\n    None\n    B-\n    B-N\n    —\n  \n  \n    C-18\n    18.0268\n    9.20 × 10−2\n    3\n    B-\n    B-N\n    —\n  \n  \n    C-19\n    19.0348\n    4.63 × 10−2\n    None\n    B-\n    B-N\n    B-2N\n  \n  \n    C-20\n    20.0403\n    1.63 × 10−2\n    None\n    B-\n    B-N\n    B-2N\n  \n  \n    C-22\n    22.0576\n    6.10 × 10−3\n    None\n    B-\n    B-N\n    B-2N\n  \n\n  \n  \n  \n    Data obtained from the nuclides dataset.\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n        \n\n\nThough the order of things matters when setting styles via tab_style(), it’s not a problem here to set a style for the combined ‘header’ location after doing so for the ‘title’ and ‘subtitle’ locations because the ‘font’ attribute wasn’t set by tab_style() for those smaller locations.\n\n\nHow tab_style() fits in with tab_options()\nWhen it comes to styling, you can use tab_options() for some of the basics and use tab_style() for the more demanding styling tasks. And you could combine the usage of both in your table. Let’s set a default honeydew background fill on the body values:\n\ngt_tbl = gt_tbl.tab_options(table_background_color=\"HoneyDew\")\n\ngt_tbl\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n    Isotopes of Carbon\n  \n  \n    There are two stable isotopes of carbon and twelve that are unstable.\n  \n\n  Isotope\n  Atomic Mass\n  Half Life, s\n  Isospin\n  \n    Decay Mode\n  \n\n\n  1\n  2\n  3\n\n\n\n  \n    C-8\n    8.0376\n    3.51 × 10−21\n    2\n    2P\n    —\n    —\n  \n  \n    C-9\n    9.0310\n    1.26 × 10−1\n    3/2\n    EC+B+\n    B+P\n    B+A\n  \n  \n    C-10\n    10.0169\n    1.93 × 101\n    1\n    EC+B+\n    —\n    —\n  \n  \n    C-11\n    11.0114\n    1.22 × 103\n    1/2\n    EC+B+\n    —\n    —\n  \n  \n    C-12\n    12.0000\n    STABLE\n    0\n    —\n    —\n    —\n  \n  \n    C-13\n    13.0034\n    STABLE\n    1/2\n    —\n    —\n    —\n  \n  \n    C-14\n    14.0032\n    1.80 × 1011\n    1\n    B-\n    —\n    —\n  \n  \n    C-15\n    15.0106\n    2.45\n    3/2\n    B-\n    —\n    —\n  \n  \n    C-16\n    16.0147\n    7.47 × 10−1\n    2\n    B-\n    B-N\n    —\n  \n  \n    C-17\n    17.0226\n    1.93 × 10−1\n    None\n    B-\n    B-N\n    —\n  \n  \n    C-18\n    18.0268\n    9.20 × 10−2\n    3\n    B-\n    B-N\n    —\n  \n  \n    C-19\n    19.0348\n    4.63 × 10−2\n    None\n    B-\n    B-N\n    B-2N\n  \n  \n    C-20\n    20.0403\n    1.63 × 10−2\n    None\n    B-\n    B-N\n    B-2N\n  \n  \n    C-22\n    22.0576\n    6.10 × 10−3\n    None\n    B-\n    B-N\n    B-2N\n  \n\n  \n  \n  \n    Data obtained from the nuclides dataset.\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n        \n\n\nIn the example, we asked for the HoneyDew background fill on the entire table with tab_options(). However, even though tab_options() was used after those tab_style() invocations, the ‘HoneyDew’ background color was only applied to the locations that didn’t have a background color set through tab_style(). The important takeaway here is that the precedence (or priority) is *always* given totab_style()`, regardless of the order of invocation.\n\n\nWrapping up\nWe’d like to thank Tim Paine for getting the expanded loc work off the ground. Additionally, we are grateful to Jerry Wu for his contributions to the v0.13.0 release of the package.\nWe’d be very pleased to receive comments or suggestions on the new functionality. GitHub Issues or GitHub Discussions are both fine venues for getting in touch with us. Finally, if ever you want to talk about tables with us, you’re always welcome to jump into our Discord Server."

Not doing so can lead to LaTeX rendering errors, potentially breaking an entire publishing workflow. Great Tables will automatically escape characters in LaTeX, limiting such errors."

We depend on the commonmark library to perform Markdown-to-HTML transformation but the library doesn’t support LaTeX output.\nStyling a LaTeX table is currently not possible. Having a tab_style() statement in your GT code and subsequently using as_latex() won’t raise an error, but it will warn and essentially no-op. Many of the options available in tab_options() are those that perform styling\nAs development continues, we will work to expand the capabilities of the as_latex() method to reduce these limitations and more clearly document what is and is not supported."

Here at Great Tables, we’re not just interested in the beautiful display of tables, but your success in defeating the person in the cubicle next to you.\nAs a final shout out, we used the python data analysis tool Polars for all the data analysis. Using Polars with Great Tables was a total delight. To learn more about how we analyzed the data, along with the code, see the appendix below!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteAppendix: analysis and code\n\n\n\n\n\nAppendix: analysis and code\n\nMethod\nIn order to calculate the probability of a given square winning, we focused on the joint probability of observing a final digit for the home team AND a final digit for the away team.\nThis can be expressed as p(home_digit, away_digit | home=\"SF\", away=\"KC\").

    "text": "Why focus on open source in public transit?\nPeople doing analytics in public transit are active in developing open data standards (like GTFS, GTFS-RT, and TIDES). These open data sources are complex—they cover schedules that change from week to week, buses moving in realtime, and passenger events. As people like me work more and more on open source tools, we start to lose touch with data analysis in realistic, complex settings. Working on open source transit data is an opportunity for me to ensure my open source tooling work helps people solve real, complex problems.\nAn inspiration for this angle is the book R for Data Science, which uses realistic datasets—like NYC flights data—to teach data analysis using an ecosystem of packages called the Tidyverse. The Tidyverse packages have dozens of example datasets, and I think this focus on working through examples is part of what made their design so great.\nA few years ago, I worked with the Cal-ITP project to build out a warehouse for their GTFS schedule and realtime data. This left a profound impression on me: transit data is perfect for educating on data analyses in R and Python, as well as analytics engineering with tools like dbt or sqlmesh. Many analysts in public transit are querying warehouses, which opens up interesting use-cases with tools like dbplyr (in R) and ibis (in Python).\n(I’m also inspired by tools like tidytransit, and other communities like pharmaverse.org.)\nHere are some relevant talks:\n\nTidy Transit: Real Life Data Modeling for Public Transportation (Hunter Owens, Cal-ITP)\nThe Accidental Analytics Engineer (Michael Chow)"

If you’re working on analytics in public transit, I would love to hear about what you’re working on, and the tools you use most.\nOne topic I’ve discussed with a few agencies is ghost buses, which is when a bus is scheduled but never shows up. This is an interesting analysis because it combines GTFS schedule data with GTFS-RT realtime bus data.\nAnother is passenger events (e.g. people tapping on or off a bus). This data is challenging because different vendors data record and deliver this data in different ways.
