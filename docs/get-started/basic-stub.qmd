title: Stub (row labels)

The **Stub** is the area to the left in a table that contains *row labels*, and may contain *row group labels*, and *summary labels*. Those subparts can be grouped in a sequence of *row groups*. The **Stub Head** provides a location for a label that describes the **Stub**. The **Stub** is optional since there are cases where a **Stub** wouldn't be useful (i.e., the display tables presented above were just fine without a **Stub**).

## Row names

An easy way to generate a **Stub** part is by specifying a stub column in the `GT()` class with the `rowname_col` argument. This will signal to **Great Tables** that the named column should be used as the stub, making *row labels*. Let's add a stub with our `islands_tbl` dataset by modifying the call to `GT()`:

```{python}
from great_tables import GT, md, html
from great_tables.data import islands

islands_mini = islands.head(10)

GT(islands_mini, rowname_col="name")
```

Notice that the landmass names are off the the left in an unstriped area? That's the **Stub**. We can apply what's known as a *stubhead label*. This label can be added with the `tab_stubhead()` method:

```{python}
(
    GT(islands_mini, rowname_col="name")
    .tab_stubhead(label="landmass")
)
```

A very important thing to note here is that the table now has one column. Before, when there was no **stub**, two columns were present (with **Column Labels** `"name"` and `"size"`) but now column number `1` (the only column) is `size`.

## Row groups

Let's incorporate row groups into the display table. This divides rows into groups, creating *row groups*, and results in a display of a *row group labels* right above the each group. This can be easily done with a table containing row labels. We can make a new *row group* with each call of the `tab_row_group()` method. The inputs are row group names in the `label` argument, and row references in the `rows` argument. We can use any of the strategies to reference rows as we did we footnotes (e.g., vectors of names/indices, select helpers, etc.).

Here we will create three row groups (with row group labels `"continent"`, `"country"`, and `"subregion"`) to have a grouping of rows.

```{python}
island_groups = islands.head(10).assign(group = ["subregion"] * 2 + ["country"] * 2 + ["continent"] * 6)

GT(island_groups, rowname_col="name", groupname_col="group").tab_stubhead(label="landmass")
```
