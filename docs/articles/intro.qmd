_Absolutely Delightful Table-making in Python_

</div>

With **Great Tables** anyone can make wonderful-looking tables in Python. The philosophy here is that we can construct a wide variety of useful tables by working with a cohesive set of table components. You can mix and match things like a _header_ and _footer_, attach a _stub_ (which contains row labels), arrange _spanner labels_ over top of the _column labels_, and much more. Not only that, but you can format the cell values in a variety of awesome ways.

It all begins with **table data** in the form of a **Pandas** or **Polars** DataFrame. You then decide how to compose your output table with the elements and formatting you need for the task at hand. Finally, the table is rendered by printing it at the console, including it in an notebook environment, or rendering it inside a **Quarto** document.

The **Great Tables** package is designed to be both straightforward yet powerful. The emphasis is on simple methods for the everyday display table needs (but power when you need it). Here is a brief example of how to use **Great Tables** to create a table from the included `sp500` dataset:

```python
from great_tables import GT
from great_tables.data import sp500

# Define the start and end dates for the data range
start_date = "2010-06-07"
end_date = "2010-06-14"

# Filter sp500 using Pandas to dates between `start_date` and `end_date`
sp500_mini = sp500[(sp500["date"] >= start_date) & (sp500["date"] <= end_date)]

# Create a gt table based on the `sp500_mini` table data
(
    GT(sp500_mini)
    .tab_header(title="S&P 500", subtitle=f"{start_date} to {end_date}")
    .fmt_currency(columns=["open", "high", "low", "close"])
    .fmt_date(columns="date", date_style="wd_m_day_year")
    .fmt_number(columns="volume", compact=True)
    .cols_hide(columns="adj_close")
)
```

There are 16 datasets provided by **Great Tables**: `countrypops`, `sza`, `gtcars`, `sp500`, `pizzaplace`, `exibble`, `towny`, `peeps`, `films`, `metro`, `gibraltar`, `constants`, `illness`, `reactions`, `photolysis`, and `nuclides`.

All of this tabular data is great for experimenting with the functionality available inside **Great Tables** and we make extensive use of these datasets in our documentation.

Beyond the methods shown in the simple `sp500`-based example, there are many possible ways to create super-customized tables. Check out the [documentation website](https://posit-dev.github.io/great-tables/) to get started via introductory articles for making **Great Tables**. There's a handy *Reference* section that has detailed help for every method and function in the package.
