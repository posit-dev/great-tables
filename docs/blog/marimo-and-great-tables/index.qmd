title: "Great Tables + marimo = Interactive Tables"

Jerry Wu's [recent post](https://tech.ycwu.space/posts/gt-marimo-in-quarto/20250612.html) demonstrates how Great Tables can be made reactive in a marimo notebook. The demo showcases a really nice integration where marimo's reactive widgets can be embedded directly into Great Tables using the `html()` helper function. This effectively creates an interactive table that updates in real-time whenever users interact with the controls.

## Quick Demo

The marimo reactive widgets can be embedded into a GT table through the [`html()`](https://posit-dev.github.io/great-tables/reference/html.html) helper function. In Jerry's example, the table responds to widget changes in the `opt_stylize()` method call, where the `.value` attributes for all of the widgets are passed in as arguments.

```python
gt.opt_stylize(
    style=style_widget.value,
    color=color_widget.value,
    add_row_striping=row_striping_widget.value,
)
```

## Quick Video, by marimo

The marimo team must have seen that post and liked what they saw! They recently released a video showcasing how marimo widgets work with Great Tables to create reactive tables.

## marimo + Quarto Integration

For those interested in embedding marimo notebooks directly in Quarto documents, the marimo team has also created a [quarto-marimo plugin](https://github.com/marimo-team/quarto-marimo). This extension allows you to run marimo code blocks natively within Quarto documents, making it easy to create interactive content that combines the best of both tools. It's a very exciting development since we use Quarto extensively (our docs and this very blog post were authored through Quarto!). And naturally there's a video for this as well.
