Jerry Wu's [recent post](https://tech.ycwu.space/posts/gt-marimo-in-quarto/20250612.html) demonstrates how Great Tables can be made reactive in a marimo notebook. The demo showcases a really nice integration where marimo's reactive widgets can be embedded directly into Great Tables using the `html()` helper function. This effectively creates an interactive table that updates in real-time whenever users interact with the controls.

The marimo reactive widgets can be embedded into a GT table through the [`html()`](https://posit-dev.github.io/great-tables/reference/html.html) helper function. In Jerry's example, the table responds to widget changes in the `opt_stylize()` method call, where the `.value` attributes for all of the widgets are passed in as arguments.

```python
gt.opt_stylize(
    style=style_widget.value,
    color=color_widget.value,
    add_row_striping=row_striping_widget.value,
)
```

The Marimo team must have seen that post and liked what they saw since they released a showcasing how Marimo widgets work with Great Tables to create reactive tables. Watch the video below!
